    "url": "https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/starflow",
    "description": "We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow…",

    "description": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) are likelihood-based models for continuous inputs. They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches…",

    "url": "https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/revisiting-uncertainty",
    "description": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is key to improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases--when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors--systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely…",

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user…",

Such memorization can lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning.\nIn this work, we develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the…",

At inference time, classic rectified flow matching 'moves' samples from a source distribution to the target distribution by solving an ordinary differential equation via integration along a velocity vector-field. At training time, the velocity vector-field is learnt by linearly interpolating between coupled samples one drawn from the source and one drawn from the target distribution randomly. This leads to ''ground-truth'' velocity…",

These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the latent space of the data compressor. This two-stage paradigm sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as hand-crafted compressors architectures are used for different data modalities. To this end, we…",

Continuous Integration proactively tests new code before it is pushed to production, helping to ensure a strong user experience and success.\nSpecifically, Continuous Integration in Looker offers:\nEarly error detection and improved data quality: Minimize unexpected errors in production. Looker’s new Continuous Integration features help LookML developers catch issues before new code changes are deployed, for higher data quality.\nValidators that:\nFlag upstream SQL changes that may break Looker dimension and measure definitions.\nIdentify dashboards and Looks that reference outdated LookML definitions.\nValidate LookML for errors and antipatterns as a part of other validations.\nEnhanced developer efficiency: Streamline your workflows and integrate Continuous Integration pipelines, for a more efficient development and code review process that automatically checks code quality and dependencies, so you can focus on delivering impactful data experiences.\nIncreased confidence in deployments: Deploy with confidence, knowing your projects have been thoroughly tested, and confident that your LookML code, SQL queries, and dashboards are robust and reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nContinuous Integration flags development issues early.\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nManage Continuous Integration directly within Looker\nLooker now lets you manage your continuous integration test suites, runs, and admin configurations within a single, integrated UI. With it, you can\nEasily monitor the status of your Continuous Integration runs and manage your test suites directly in Looker.\nLeverage powerful validators to ensure accuracy and efficiency of your SQL queries, LookML code, and content.\nTrigger Continuous Integration runs manually or automatically via pull requests or schedules whenever you need them, for control over your testing process.\nIn today's fast-paced data environment, speed, accuracy and trust are crucial. Continuous Integration in Looker helps your data team promote developmental best practices, reduce risk of introducing errors in production, and increase your organization’s confidence in its data. The result is a consistently dependable Looker experience for all users, including those in line-of-business, increasing reliability across all use cases. Continuous Integration in Looker is now available in preview. Explore its capabilities and see how it can transform your Looker development workflows. For more information, check our product documentation to learn how to enable and configure Continuous Integration for your projects.",

    "title": "Spring Data MongoDB: Now with Vector Search and Queryable Encryption",
    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/product-release-announcements/spring-data-mongodb-now-with-vector-search-queryable-encryption",
    "description": "MongoDB is pleased to announce new enhancements to the Spring Data MongoDB library with the release of version 4.5.0, increasing capabilities related to vector search, vector search index creation, and queryable encryption. Spring Data MongoDB makes it easier for developers to integrate MongoDB into their Java applications, taking advantage of a potent combination of powerful MongoDB features and familiar Spring conventions.\nVector search\nVector embeddings convert disparate types of data into numbers that capture meaning and relationships. Many types of data—words, sentences, images, even videos—can be represented by a vector embedding for use in AI applications. In MongoDB, you can easily store and index vector embeddings alongside your other document data—no need to manage a separate vector database or maintain an ETL pipeline.\nIn MongoDB, an aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents, performing operations such as $count and $group. $vectorSearch is an aggregation pipeline stage for handling vector retrieval. It was released in MongoDB 6.0, and improved upon in MongoDB 7.0 and 8.0. Using the $vectorSearch stage to pre-filter your data and perform a semantic search against indexed fields, you can easily process vector embeddings in your aggregation pipeline.\nVector search indexes\nLike other retrieval techniques, indexes are a key part of implementing vector search, allowing you to narrow the scope of your semantic search and exclude irrelevant vector embeddings. This is useful in an environment where it isn’t necessary to consider every vector embedding for comparison.\nLet’s see how easy it is to create a vector search index with Spring Data MongoDB 4.5.0!\nVectorIndex index = new VectorIndex(\"vector_index\")\n  .addVector(\"plotEmbedding\", vector -> vector.dimensions(1536).similarity(COSINE)) \n  .addFilter(\"year\"); \n\nmongoTemplate.searchIndexOps(Movie.class) \n  .createIndex(index);\n\nAs you can see, the VectorIndex class offers intuitive methods such as addVector and addFilter that allow you to define exactly, with native Spring Data APIs, the vector you want to initialize.\nTo actually execute a search operation that leverages the index, just issue an aggregation:\nVectorSearchOperation search = VectorSearchOperation.search(\"vector_index\") \n  .searchType(VectorSearchOperation.SearchType.ENN)\n  .path(\"plotEmbedding\") \n  .vector( ... )\n  .limit(10)\n  .numCandidates(150)\n  .withSearchScore(\"score\"); \n\nAggregationResults<MovieWithSearchScore> results = mongoTemplate\n  .aggregate(newAggregation(Movie.class, search), MovieWithSearchScore.class);\n\nLeverage the power of MongoDB to run sophisticated vector search, directly from Spring.\nQueryable Encryption\nSupport for vector search isn’t the only enhancement found in 4.5.0. Now, you can pass encryptedFields right into your CollectionsOptions class, giving Spring the context to understand which fields are encrypted.\nThis context allows Spring to leverage the power of MongoDB Queryable Encryption (QE) to keep sensitive data protected in transit, at rest, or in use. QE allows you to encrypt sensitive application data, store it securely in an encrypted state in the MongoDB database, and perform equality and range queries directly on the encrypted data.\nLet’s look at how easy it is to create an encrypted collection with Spring Data MongoDB:\nCollectionOptions collectionOptions = CollectionOptions.encryptedCollection(options -> options\n\t.queryable(encrypted(string(\"ssn\")).algorithm(\"Indexed\"), equality().contention(0))\n\t.queryable(encrypted(int32(\"age\")).algorithm(\"Range\"), range().contention(8).min(0).max(150))\n\t.queryable(encrypted(int64(\"address.sign\")).algorithm(\"Range\"), range().contention(2).min(-10L).max(10L))\n);\n\nmongoTemplate.createCollection(Patient.class, collectionOptions);\n\nBy declaring upfront the options allowed for different fields of the new collection, Spring and MongoDB work together to keep your data safe!\nWe’re excited for you to start incorporating these exciting new features into applications built with Spring Data MongoDB. Here are some resources to help you get started:\nExplore the Spring Data MongoDB documentation\nCheck out the GitHub repository \nRead the release notes for Spring Data MongoDB 4.5.0",

Her approach blends practical skills with theoretical understanding, ensuring her students are well-prepared for real-world challenges.\nProfessor Menzin also fosters a vibrant student community around MongoDB technology, empowering students to use these skills in their academic projects and future careers. Her MongoDB insights on curriculum and student engagement offer valuable perspectives for educators adapting to the evolving tech landscape, as you’ll see in our interview.\n1. Tell us about your educational and professional journey and what initially sparked your interest in databases and MongoDB.\nAt Simmons, we were one of the first US universities to offer an undergraduate major in data science, so we were very aware of the importance of NoSQL for handling big data. In 2017, I returned to teaching databases after a hiatus of about seven years—and when I looked at the textbooks, they hadn’t changed. But the world sure had. So, I checked the Stack Overflow survey of what professional developers were using and found that 25% of them were using MongoDB. With my colleague’s permission, I revised our course to be about one-third on NoSQL, and I had to develop my own materials. But my students adore using MongoDB.\n2. What courses related to databases and MongoDB are you currently teaching?\nI teach a one-semester database course that’s required for all students majoring in computer science, data science, and information technology/cybersecurity. I also teach a course in full-stack web development, and students learn how to access MongoDB from Node.js.\n3. What motivated you to incorporate MongoDB into your curriculum?\nI was motivated by what is happening in the real world, but as an instructor, I find that having students learn something else in addition to relational databases makes the discussions much livelier about atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions and concurrency in relational database management systems (RDBMSs). Now, students see where ACID transactions are important and where they’re not. (Yes, I know that MongoDB supports ACID transactions.) Similarly, the design process is different for MongoDB and for entity-relationship design, and that highlights the strengths of each.\nFigure 1. Professor Margaret Menzin's students at Simmons University.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n4. You have successfully built an active student community around MongoDB on your campus. Can you share some insights into how you achieved this and the impact it’s had on students?\nFirst, I tell students to put MongoDB on their curricula vitae because it gives them an edge. Second, students are so enthusiastic about MongoDB that they turn to it when they have to build projects for senior courses. I do require that students install the MongoDB Community Edition on their own computers, and—without any data to back this claim up—I think that makes it more likely that they will turn to it. And they do. This year, a group of four seniors built a complete software system for a nonprofit on our campus, and they chose to use MongoDB. (I was not the supervisor; they chose MongoDB because they liked it and thought it was the best choice.)\n5. How do you design your course content to integrate MongoDB in a way that engages students and ensures practical learning experiences?\nIn my course, I give students a set of comma-separated values (CSVs) for the Northwinds example (a pretty standard project with files for customers, products, orders, line items, etc.), and they denormalize the data. That is, they embed the line-item documents into the orders documents and do some computations, then embed the orders documents into the customers’ documents. They timed various operations with and without indexes. One thing I have learned is to put the exam on MongoDB before the project, so everyone on the team is ready to contribute to the project. I have a file of the approximately 5,000 restaurants in New York City that I use for the exam.\n6. How has MongoDB supported you in enhancing your teaching methodologies and upskilling your students?\nFirst, my students make extensive use of the MongoDB documentation. Reading documentation is an important skill for students to learn, and MongoDB’s is excellent. Second, I have gone through all the MongoDB videos for teachers, and I especially use the ones on the design process. For the aggregation pipeline, we use the book Practical MongoDB Aggregations, linked to on your site, and the Mosh Hamedani videos on YouTube. And because I was one of the very early adopters among professors, I’ve had to develop a lot of my own materials, which I’ve shared.\nFigure 2. Professor Margaret Menzin's students at Simmons University.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n7. Could you share a memorable experience or success story of a project from your time teaching MongoDB that stands out to you?\nAfter the first year I taught MongoDB, I asked my colleagues for feedback, and they suggested that I see what other people were doing on the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) LISTSERV. The result was a panel called “NoSQL is No Problem” for SIGCSE 2020. And there was a curated bibliography for various NoSQL platforms.\n8. How has your role as a MongoDB educator impacted your professional growth and the growth of the student community at your university?\nAs a faculty member, I am always trying to see what’s going to be important next and find out how to learn it. Students respond to that attitude. I also lean very heavily on small-group work and team projects in all my courses. Most of my database students are sophomores, and they don’t know each other well yet. So in any small-group work, I say, “Even if it’s your roommate, begin with ‘Hello, my name is…’” and they laugh, but it works. It happens that the database course (occurring fall of the sophomore year) is when we try to build a sense of cohesion among our majors. I also require my students to take out an ACM student membership so I can assign a variety of readings and videos, and that helps them build professional identities. And my students love the fact that this is cutting-edge and that they are moving away from textbooks. I’m sure that listing MongoDB among their skills on LinkedIn and elsewhere also helps them find internships.\n9. What advice would you give to educators who are considering integrating MongoDB into their courses to ensure a successful and impactful learning experience for students?\nAllow about 30% of a first database course for the MongoDB work. It takes me about one and a half to two weeks to get students to install and learn basic MongoDB, and then another week and a half for the project. After that, use MongoDB as a jumping-off point to circle back to topics like forms of consistency, the CAP Theorem, design trade-offs, design decisions for distributed databases, and the choice of a database model. Comparing and contrasting MongoDB with an RDBMS is a very powerful way to summarize many of the key concepts in a database course. Finally, spending the last week on these high-level issues, when all of the students’ other courses are rushing to finish their projects, will make students very grateful.\nApply to the MongoDB for Educators program and explore free resources for educators crafted by MongoDB experts to prepare learners with in-demand database skills and knowledge.",

It includes metrics like conversation volume, average conversation duration, and conversation abandonment rate. This information can help identify areas where your agent can be improved.\nConversational Insights provides the ability to discover patterns and visualize contact center data trends, offering valuable insights into constituent sentiment, call topics, and agent support needs. This can help identify areas for improvement in the constituent experience. However, analyzing information through the console can be challenging. Custom reports developed with Looker simplify the process of analytics and make trend analysis easier.\nStandard Reports allow you to export your Insights data into BigQuery. This allows you to create tailored reports using tools like Looker and Looker Studio. This can give you even more insights into your contact center data - such as conversation sentiment, word clouds with popular entities, Agent Performance reports and conversation specific reporting. Looker Blocks for Contact Center as a Service provides pre-built data models, dashboards, and reports specifically designed for contact center analytics. This accelerates the process of setting up and visualizing contact center data. Understanding conversational data supports mission effectiveness, drives value for the agency, improves operational efficiency, and enhances the overall constituent experience.\nImplementing analytics with Contact Center as a Service\nTo get these pre-made reports that uncover insights from Contact Center Operations using Looker Blocks, you'll need to do two things.\nFirst, export ConversationaI Insights data into BigQuery. The best way to do this is to set up a scheduled data feed through data engineering pipelines. This automation ensures data synchronization to BigQuery, eliminating the need for manual exports and preventing data loss.\nNext, log in to your Looker console, go to the Looker Marketplace, and install the block. Once it's installed, point it to the BigQuery export datasets, and voila! The dashboards are ready for you to use. Looker Blocks have the ability to recognize the data model and produce metrics for contact center operations. Besides the ready-made dashboards, blocks can also be used as a foundation for reporting and can be tailored to your specific requirements within the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nConversational Agent to Looker analytics pipeline leveraging BigQuery for storage and processing\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nOverall, these tools can help improve the performance of your contact center. By understanding your agent's performance, identifying patterns in your contact center data, and creating tailored reports, you can empower agency call center staff with data-driven decisions that enhance the constituent experience.\nA great example of this technology in action is in Sullivan County, New York. The county faced the challenge of effectively serving a growing population and managing high inquiry volumes with limited staff and budget. To address this and enhance constituent engagement, they implemented a conversational agent, providing 24/7 online assistance and freeing up county employees for more complex problem-solving. By using Google Cloud’s latest innovations, the county launched a chatbot that streamlined communication. Looker was instrumental in identifying crucial insights, including a 62% year-over-year drop in constituent call volume, tracking their expansion to 24-hour service availability, further augmenting staff capacity and providing Sullivan County constituents with the best possible service.\nTapping into Looker and BigQuery to streamline contact center analytics\nLooker is a complete AI for business intelligence (BI) platform allowing users to explore data, chat with their data via AI agents using natural language, and create dashboards and self-service reports with as little as a single natural language query.

We’re also introducing the next wave of Chromebook Plus devices, including the brand-new Lenovo Chromebook Plus, an innovative device powered by the most advanced processor in a Chromebook ever—the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra.\nThis moment also marks a milestone in our larger effort to improve our hybrid computing approach to AI. With built-in NPU (neural processing unit) capabilities on Chromebook Plus, we now offer on-device AI for offline use, complemented by cloud-based capabilities that benefit from continuous updates and advancements. This hybrid approach allows us to balance performance, efficiency, privacy, cost, and reliability in Chromebook Plus.\nThe latest in Chromebook Plus\nThe Lenovo Chromebook Plus (14”, 10) is the world’s first Chromebook with an NPU and NPU-enabled capabilities. Powered by MediaTek’s Kompanio Ultra processor, and boasting 50 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of AI processing power to enable on-device generative AI experiences, this intelligent device is built to keep up with modern workers and offer up to 17 hours of battery life. Learn more.\nThe Lenovo Chromebook Plus also comes with exclusive AI features built in. Organization is easy with Smart grouping, which provides you with a glanceable chip of your recent tabs and apps. You can also automatically group related items, move them to a new desk, or reopen all tabs in a single window. And with On device image generation, you can effortlessly turn any image into a sticker or standalone graphic with a transparent background, ready for use in Google Slides, Docs, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nSmart Grouping\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nA device for every need\nWe also understand that every business has its own unique needs and requirements. That’s why we’re so excited to expand the Chromebook portfolio with additional devices, including the ASUS Chromebook Plus CX15, ASUS Chromebook Plus CX14, and the ASUS Chromebook CX14. These additions further broaden the range of choices available, ensuring businesses can find a device that aligns with both their operational needs and budget.\nWhen it comes to modernizing your team, the right device can make all the difference.\n\nFor cost-conscious businesses, who prioritize a highly affordable and reliable solution for essential tasks like email, web browsing, and cloud-based applications, standard Chromebooks offer exceptional value.\nFor enhanced interactions and versatility, especially for teams in retail, field services, or more creative roles, we offer touchscreen options, as well as detachable and convertible form factors so you can adapt to various work environments and presentation styles.\nFor advanced use cases and future-proofing, and employees that require cutting-edge performance, Chromebook Plus devices are the ideal choice. With powerful processors, more memory, double the storage of standard Chromebooks, and on-device AI capabilities, these devices are equipped to handle the next generation of productivity tools and smart features, future-proofing your investment.\n\nNew Google AI features to supercharge your workforce\nAlong with all of this new hardware, we’re also introducing new and updated features built directly into Chromebook and Chromebook Plus.\nFor productivity, we’ve enhanced Help me read, which now can simplify complex language into more straightforward, digestible text. This is perfect for quickly grasping complicated topics, technical documents, or anything that might otherwise require more time to understand. Additionally, we’re introducing the new Text capture feature. Leveraging generative AI, it extracts specific information from anything on your screen and provides contextual recommendations. Imagine automatically adding events to your calendar directly from an email banner, or effortlessly taking a receipt screenshot and pulling that data into a spreadsheet for easier tracking. Finally, Select to search with Lens helps you get more information from whatever is on your screen. Whether you’re curious about a landmark, a product, or anything else, this feature helps you quickly identify and learn more about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nText Capture\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nJust as critical as productivity is empowering teams to unleash their creativity. With that in mind, we’ve improved Quick Insert to now include image generation capabilities. With just the press of a button, you can generate high-quality AI images and instantly insert them into your emails, slides, documents, and more. Need a unique visual for a presentation or an email? Simply describe it, and let AI bring your vision to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nQuick Insert with Image Generation\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nAs always, these features come with built-in policies, ensuring IT admins maintain full control over your organization’s access and usage of AI.\nPreparing for the future of work\nWe continue to invest in making Chromebook Plus the definitive choice for businesses seeking to modernize their operations, empower their end-users with productivity and creativity, and prepare for the evolving demands of the future of work. With Chromebook Plus, your organization gains a secure, intelligent, and powerful platform designed to drive progress today and into tomorrow.\nClick here to learn about ChromeOS devices, and discover which device is best for your business.",

首页报道了伊朗和美国之间的紧张局势升级。\n伊朗总统马苏德·佩泽什基安表示，美国对伊朗的侵略行为“必须得到回应”，此前美国轰炸了伊朗的三个核设施。美国总统唐纳德·特朗普则声称这些打击行动“将‘炸弹’从他们手中夺走”。联合国核监督机构表示，无法确定福特地下设施的损坏程度，而伊朗外交部长则表示，伊朗的核知识“不会被轰炸摧毁”。\n\nBBC 核实了伊斯法罕和纳坦兹以及福特的卫星图像，以评估美国空袭造成的损害。\n与此同时，伊朗和以色列继续相互开火，以色列声称击中了数十个军事目标，而伊朗红新月会指责以色列袭击了医院和医疗中心。\n美国国防部长皮特·黑格斯表示，这些打击行动不是为了政权更迭，而是为了阻止伊朗获得核武器。\nBBC 安全记者弗兰克·加德纳提出了一个更令人担忧的问题：伊朗是否仍有足够的高浓缩铀（HEU）隐藏在秘密地下位置，以及知识和手段将其武器化，从而决定制造一个原始的核弹？换句话说，美国和以色列的联合攻击是否消除了伊朗成为核武装国家的可能性，还是使其更有可能？\n以色列驻联合国代表丹尼·达农表示，世界应该感谢唐纳德·特朗普。他说，有些人在联合国谴责美国和以色列，但他质疑“当伊朗的铀浓缩远超民用目的，当它在山下建造堡垒准备我们的灭绝时，你们在哪里？”\n伊朗驻联合国代表阿米尔·赛义德·伊拉瓦尼指责美国对伊朗发动了一场“战争”，并称伊朗有权“自卫”对抗“公然的美国侵略”。他还指责以色列总理内塔尼亚胡将美国卷入“另一场代价高昂、毫无根据的战争”，并称美国和以色列的行为是“公然违反国际法”。\n伊朗伊斯法罕省省长表示，以色列空袭导致一辆救护车被击中，造成三人死亡。伊朗国家电视台也报道了这一事件，当地居民表示以色列正在针对平民。以色列尚未对这一事件作出回应，但表示其在伊朗的行动是针对军事设施的。\n美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在社交媒体上表示，对伊朗核设施的破坏是“巨大的”。他赞扬了美军的精准打击和技能。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44341639\n以色列轰炸伊朗核设施是针对未授权的武器级铀浓缩设施，这些设施位于人口中心之外的山区。\n内塔尼亚胡因腐败指控可能入狱，但只要他能领导以色列处于紧急状态，这些指控可以被推迟或绕过。\n新的对伊朗战争转移了人们对加沙发生事情的注意力，加沙的饥饿问题进入了一个新临界阶段。\n内塔尼亚胡的腐败指控可能无法证明，不应基于政治化的报道来假设其有罪或无罪。\n有人认为内塔尼亚胡应该因种族灭绝行为被监禁，而不仅仅是腐败指控。\n有人反对将以色列的行为称为种族灭绝，认为这种说法不诚实。\n有人提到加沙没有民主选举的政府，以色列作为占领力量阻止了选举。\n有人认为以色列的行为符合种族灭绝和种族清洗的所有标准。\n有人认为特朗普是法西斯倾向的独裁者。\n以色列明确针对平民、援助工作者、记者、难民营、食品分发点，甚至在教堂中射击藏匿的人，这些都不是合法目标。\n以色列在加沙的行为类似于种族灭绝，但以色列和哈马斯都有种族灭绝的意图，只是哈马斯能力较小。\n根据国际法，任何被敌方用于军事目的的物体，包括医院和学校，都是合法的攻击目标。\n#\n\n\n  https://fellerts.no/projects/epoch.html\n这篇文章是 Fredrik Flornes Ellertsen 关于他制作机械手表爆炸视图模型的经历和过程的分享。文章开始于他对 Bartosz Ciechanowski 博客中关于机械手表运动工作原理的解释的赞赏，特别是那些互动插图。作者表达了想要亲手制作一个真实的机械手表爆炸视图模型的愿望，但在寻找现成模型时发现市场上并没有符合他要求的产品。\n文章接着描述了作者决定自己动手制作这样一个模型的过程。他首先考虑了要“爆炸”的机械手表运动类型，认为基于 ETA 2824-2 机械手表运动（或其克隆版本）的博客帖子是一个不错的选择，但考虑到其复杂性，他选择了更简单、更老式的怀表运动作为起点。\n作者面临的挑战是如何将 50-100 个微小的组件悬浮起来，形成一个爆炸视图。他尝试了分层树脂铸造的方法，但由于树脂的黄色色调、固化速度慢和层间接缝明显等问题，这种方法并不成功。他尝试了使用 UV 光固化树脂和传统的双组分环氧树脂，但都遇到了问题。\n在多次尝试后，作者决定采用一次性铸造整个模型的方法，并使用钓鱼线来悬挂每个组件。他选择了单丝尼龙线，因为它的折射率与环氧树脂相似，且价格便宜。他通过在烤箱中烘烤来矫正线的弯曲，并用 CA 胶将组件粘在线上，这个过程与真正的手表制作有些相似。\n文章最后，作者提到了他在制作过程中遇到的挑战，包括需要精细操作和稳定的手，以及如何使用 CA 胶代替润滑油来处理微小的组件。尽管面临困难，但他对完成这个项目感到兴奋和期待。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44347425\nBartosz Ciechanowski 的博客文章是关于机械手表的最佳网络资源之一。\n作者展示了许多类似的详细作品，可以在其个人网站上查看。\n这篇文章三年前在 Hacker News 上讨论过，获得了极高的评分。\n有人提到了将物品封入树脂并用水流切割机切割以创建“爆炸视图”的艺术家。\n有人提出了通过调整树脂的折射率来使钓鱼线完全消失的想法。\n作者回应称没有深入考虑过这个想法，但搜索后发现光学领域有很多先例。\n有人分享了使用不同粗细的砂纸打磨树脂铸件以获得完美立方体的经验。\n作者回应称自己可能会厌倦打磨工作，并提到了使用抛光/打磨工具的可能性。\n有人建议使用砂纸和玻璃片来获得非常平坦的表面。\n有人对作者使用 PT5000 机芯表示赞赏，并提到中国手表制造业的惊人之处。\n有人询问关于在 AliExpress 购买机械手表克隆版的最佳资源。\n有人提到了消费者电子产品的加工和组装过程对手表制造业的帮助。\n作者计划学习如何制作计时器，并赞扬了中国制造的可靠性和价格合理性。\n有人表达了对破坏这些精密机械的矛盾感，但也认为这种展示非常酷。\n有人提到了古董店中以黄铜重量出售的怀表，以及它们作为手表修复技术实践材料的价值。\n有人询问如何开始学习手表修复作为爱好。\n#\n\n\n  https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2022/11/19/git-notes-gits-coolest-most-unloved-feature/\n这篇文章是关于 Git 的一个不太为人知但非常强大的特性——Git 笔记（git notes）的介绍和讨论。\n首先，文章指出 Git 笔记几乎是一个秘密，因为它们的易用性令人困扰，但它们被工程师们不断重新发现，用于在 Git 中存储元数据。Git 笔记允许你在特殊的命名空间中添加关于旧提交的新信息，而且它们的功能远不止于此。你可以为 Git 跟踪的任何对象（提交、blob 和树）添加笔记，而不需要修改对象本身。\n文章接着介绍了如何为最新的提交添加笔记，并展示了如何在 git log 中显示这些笔记。例如，可以添加一个“Acked-by”的笔记，表示某个人确认了代码。\n文章还提到了 Git 笔记在实际中的应用案例，比如 Git 项目本身将每个提交与其邮件列表上的讨论链接起来。其他人使用笔记来跟踪每个提交或分支上花费的时间、添加审查和测试信息到 git log，甚至进行完全分布式的代码审查。\n文章特别提到了一个名为 reviewnotes 的插件，它允许用户在 git log 中看到谁审查了代码，以及运行了哪些测试，而不需要打开浏览器。\n然后，文章讨论了如何使用 Git 笔记存储代码审查和测试结果，以及一个名为 git-appraise 的系统，它是一个建立在 Git 笔记之上的完整的代码审查系统，允许用户请求审查、评论变更、审查和合并变更，所有这些都可以在本地计算机上完成，即使 GitHub 宕机也没关系。\n最后，文章指出 Git 笔记的使用并不普遍，因为它们难以使用，而且 GitHub 在 2014 年停止显示提交笔记，没有给出太多解释。尽管如此，Git

https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/tpu.html\n本文深入探讨了谷歌的张量处理单元（TPU），与图形处理单元（GPU）在设计哲学上的不同，尤其是在可扩展性、能效和计算架构方面。\n#\n\nTPU 是谷歌自定义的应用特定集成电路（ASIC），旨在实现极高的矩阵乘法（matmul）吞吐量和能效。TPU 的起源可以追溯到 2006 年，谷歌在当时评估使用 GPU、FPGA 或定制 ASIC 的可能性。2013 年，随着谷歌语音搜索功能转向神经网络，计算需求的预测促使谷歌开发 TPU。\n\n如今，TPU 已支持谷歌大部分的 AI 服务，包括训练和推理模型。接下来，文章将深入分析 TPU 的内部架构。\n#\n\n以 TPUv4 为例，每个 TPU 芯片包含两个 TPU 张量核心（TensorCore），每个张量核心有 128MiB 的共享内存（CMEM）和 32GiB 的高带宽内存（HBM）。每个张量核心内又包括多个计算单元和小型内存缓冲区：\n** 矩阵乘法单元（MXU）**：这是张量核心的关键组件，使用 128x128 的脉动阵列（systolic array）。\n** 向量单元（VPU）**：用于一般元素级运算（如 ReLU、点加 / 乘、归约等）。\n** 向量内存（VMEM；32MiB）**：用于存储从 HBM 复制的数据。\n** 标量单元及标量内存（SMEM；10MiB）**：负责控制流、标量运算和内存地址生成。\n与 GPU 不同的是，TPU 的片上内存单位（CMEM、VMEM、SMEM）较大，而 HBM 较小，且 TPU 的计算核心数量远少于 GPU。\nTPU 能够实现极高的吞吐量，如 TPUv5p 每个芯片可达到 500 TFLOPs/sec，完整的 8960 芯片组合可实现约 4.45 ExaFLOPs/sec 的性能。\n#\n\nTPU 的设计哲学基于以下两个核心要素和一个关键假设：\n** 脉动阵列与流水线（Systolic Arrays + Pipelining）**：脉动阵列是一种硬件设计架构，由一组互联的处理单元（PE）组成。每个 PE 执行小型计算（如乘法和累加），并将结果传递给邻近的 PE。这种设计可以降低对额外控制逻辑的需求，并实现高效的数据流动。\n** 提前编译（Ahead-of-Time Compilation）与较少依赖缓存 **：TPU 通过与 XLA 编译器的硬件 - 软件协同设计，避免使用传统缓存，以降低能耗。XLA 编译器能够在运行时分析计算图，从而优化内存访问，减少不必要的缓存操作。\n#\n\nTPU 的可扩展性在多芯片配置中表现得尤为突出。一个 TPU 托盘包含 4 个 TPU 芯片，并通过 PCIe 与 CPU 主机连接，芯片之间则通过更高带宽的内核间互联（ICI）连接。\n一个 TPU 机架由 64 个芯片组成，采用 4x4x4 的三维环形结构，芯片间的通信通过 ICI 和光电切换（OCS）实现。\nTPU 的不同配置概念包括：\n**TPU 机架 **：物理单位，包含 64 个芯片。\nTPU Pod（超级 Pod）：最大配置的 TPU 单元，连接多个机架（例如，TPUv4 的 Pod 包含 4096 个芯片）。\nTPU Slice：介于 4 个芯片和超级 Pod 之间的任意 TPU 配置。\n通过将多个芯片、机架连接在一起，TPU 的设计哲学显示出其在高并行处理和快速通信方面的优势，支持大规模的深度学习任务。\n#\n\nTPU 的设计理念强调高效的硬件架构与软件编译技术的结合，专注于特定的计算任务（如矩阵乘法），从而在能效和吞吐量上表现优异。随着 TPU 技术的不断进步，其在 AI 领域的应用潜力将更加广泛。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44342977\n华尔街从一开始就低估了谷歌，市值并不等同于企业价值。\n出售 TPU 需要建立基础设施，而出租可以保持更高的利润率，同时避免增强竞争对手。\n谷歌的 TPU 与 TensorFlow 框架紧密绑定，导致软件支持不足，影响了 TPU 的采用。\n谷歌将 TPU 限制在自家云服务中，这限制了开源社区和学术界的贡献。\n谷歌可能已经是第二梯队的 AI 芯片制造商，市值可能已经反映了这一点。\nJAX/FLAX 等软件支持 TPU，谷歌在研究工作中使用这些工具而非 PyTorch。\n谷歌通过 TRC 项目免费提供 TPU 资源，以增加 JAX 的使用和影响力。\nBroadcom 参与 TPU 的制造和网络基础设施，其市值为 1.2T，可能需要将其与谷歌的市值合并考虑。\nNvidia 同时进行硬件和软件栈的开发，而 Broadcom 是无晶圆厂公司，主要负责硬件设计。\nNvidia 通过销售芯片获得利润，而谷歌通过制造 TPU 节省资金，长期来看可能更有优势。\nNvidia 可能被高估，但至少它们是盈利的，与 WeWork 和 Uber 不同。\n谷歌保留 TPU 作为竞争优势，有利于其核心产品的长期发展。\n#\n\n\n  https://www.axios.com/2025/06/21/us-strike-iran-nuclear-israel-trump\n这篇文章报道了美国对伊朗核设施进行空袭的最新情况。\n美国军方在当地时间周日上午对伊朗的核设施进行了空袭，目标是 Fordow、Natanz 和 Isfahan。美国总统特朗普在白宫发表的历史性讲话中称这次行动是“壮观的军事成功”，并声称伊朗的主要铀浓缩场所“已被完全彻底摧毁”。特朗普表示：“伊朗，中东的恶霸，现在必须寻求和平。”他警告说，如果伊朗不迅速实现和平，将面临比过去八天所见更大的悲剧。\n这次空袭是特朗普直接支持以色列努力拆除伊朗核计划的决定，标志着中东地区的历史性升级。这一干预充满了风险和不确定性，特朗普和他的许多前任都试图避免，包括通过与伊朗的外交手段。这次袭击发生在以色列和伊朗之间前所未有的战争的第九个晚上，可能会引发德黑兰对美国在该地区的军队和军事设施的报复。\n特朗普在 Truth Social 上发文表示：“伊朗对美国的任何报复都将遭到比今晚所见更强大的力量回击。”在周六晚上的讲话中，特朗普表示，空袭的目标是摧毁伊朗的核浓缩能力，阻止“头号恐怖主义国家赞助者”的核威胁。特朗普感谢以色列总理内塔尼亚胡，表示他们像前所未有的团队一样合作，已经消除了对以色列的威胁。\n特朗普警告说，美国在伊朗还有许多目标，如果与伊斯兰共和国的和平“不迅速到来”，军方将“在几分钟内”将它们摧毁。以色列官员表示，特朗普政府在空袭前通知了以色列。白宫官员告诉 Axios，特朗普在行动后与内塔尼亚胡通话。另一位以色列高级官员告诉 Axios，空袭中使用了 B-2 隐形轰炸机。\n伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队在周日威胁要对美国在中东的军队进行打击。伊朗外交部长阿巴斯·阿拉格奇在伊斯坦布尔的新闻发布会上表示，德黑兰“保留所有捍卫其安全的选项”，并表示伊朗目前对外交不感兴趣。他指出，美国越过了一个很大的红线，伊朗将根据自己的权利做出回应。阿拉格奇没有详细说明可能的伊朗回应，也没有明确表示伊朗是否会退出核不扩散条约或关闭霍尔木兹海峡。他表示，伊朗有多种选项。\n伊朗原子能组织证实了三个核设施遭到袭击，并谴责“美国敌人”进行了“违反国际法的野蛮行为”。该组织表示，尽管敌人的邪恶阴谋，伊朗不会被阻止继续发展其国家核能产业。\n特朗普在讲话中表示，伊朗 40 年来一直在说“美国去死”，“以色列去死”。他们杀害了我们的人民，用路边炸弹炸掉他们的手臂和腿。他继续说，中东和世界各地成千上万的人直接死于他们的仇恨。特别是，许多人被他们的将军卡西姆·苏莱曼尼杀害，他指的是伊朗军事领导人，特朗普在第一任期下令暗杀他。\n内塔尼亚胡在发布的视频中用英语表示：“特朗普总统和我总是说：‘和平通过力量。’首先是力量，然后是和平。今晚，特朗普总统和美国展现了很多力量。”\n在空袭前的几天里，特朗普和他的团队越来越相信外交已经走到了尽头——为了消除伊朗的核计划，必须采取军事行动。特朗普周四公开宣布，他将在未来两周内做出决定，给伊朗一个最后的谈判机会，但空袭的准备工作在周末加速进行。周六，多架能够携带 3 万磅“地堡破坏者”的 B-2 隐形轰炸机被检测到向西穿越太平洋，人们猜测美国将打击 Fordow。\n特朗普公开质疑以色列是否有能力独自摧毁地下设施，他说：“他们可以突破一小部分，但他们不能深入。”在幕后，特朗普的“美国优先”基础对于是否加入以色列的战争一直存在严重分歧，但特朗普在一个问题上一直坚定不移：伊朗绝不能被允许获得核武器。他上周做出了最后的努力，以避免美国干预，探索在伊斯坦布尔与伊朗官员的秘密会晤，由土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安促成。特朗普愿意派遣白宫特使史蒂夫·维特科夫和副总统万斯——或者如果必要的话，甚至亲自参加会谈。但当伊朗最高领袖阿里·哈梅内伊因担心以色列暗杀而躲藏起来，无法授权会面时，这一努力失败了。从那时起，伊朗拒绝与美国直接接触，除非以色列停止攻击。特朗普现在相信不可能达成协议，似乎已经采取了他曾经希望避免的军事选项。\n#\n\n\n

毫米放映机\n全球艺术家在使用胶片电影时，常常面临因设备老化和难以修复导致的不稳定放映条件。特别是电影放映机及其老化的机械部件变得越来越不可靠，这在许多情况下导致了胶片材料的破坏，而不是确保其最佳展示。最后一款商业化的 16 毫米电影放映机是在 90 年代生产的，但大多数艺术家、档案保管员和放映员不得不使用更老旧的设备，有些甚至可以追溯到 60 年代和 50 年代。与此同时，传统工业制造商已经消失或转向其他领域，服务人员退休，备件稀缺且价格不合理。老式放映机主要为标准电影放映而设计，未能满足当代艺术家在扩展电影制作中的需求，也通常不符合档案放映的需求。随着数字革命的到来，过去十年已经大幅减少了体验模拟电影放映的机会，老式放映设备的老化技术已成为模拟电影放映及其独特体验消失的一个重要因素。\n\n我们的想法是开发一款使用开源技术和非专有/普遍可用备件的最先进的、模块化的 16 毫米电影放映机。我们认为，老式放映机的中央机械部件——爪机制、快门轮和胶片输送——在大多数情况下都设计得非常好，重新开发这些部件将是一种时间和能量的浪费。相反，我们希望在现有的、易于获得的放映机机制基础上构建放映机。光学部分也是如此：与 Eiki、Bauer、Bell & Howell 和 Hokushin 生产的放映机兼容的镜头在全球范围内都可以找到，且状况良好。这款放映机应该能够满足当代电影艺术家、档案保管员和放映员的需求。\n技术特性（愿望清单）：\n设计：模块化设计、开源技术、非专有和普遍可用备件（可 3D 打印）、可调高度和倾斜度、轻便便于旅行和放映期间的携带、可选择垂直格式投影（90° 倾斜或棱镜系统）。\n电源：110V 和 220V，可选：电池用于户外和便携式放映。\n光源：超亮、可调光 LED、色温调整以适应不同时间的印刷品，钨丝灯或氙灯或红移电影印刷品、数字快门（闪烁）。\n胶片格式：16 毫米——超 16——超 16——开放门（可切换格式掩模）。\n光学：宽变焦范围镜头 25mm – 150mm，兼容 Bauer、Eiki 和 B&H 镜头（适配管），蜗轮齿轮对焦，变形镜头支架，Elmo 查看器类型 100 的支架（无屏幕查看）。\n输送：水晶同步速度：12 – 15 – 16,66 – 18 – 23,976 – 24 – 25 – 29,97 – 30 FPS，手动变速从 <1 到 30 FPS，独立于 FPS 的变速快门轮，数字帧计数器，记忆计数器用于进出点，双向快速倒带。\n音频：光学和磁性音频（无内置放大器——仅输出），现场语音麦克风输入，耳机插孔，集成数字音频同步系统。\n连接性：与数字音频、视频和 MIDI 同步，多个放映机之间的同步，可从主控切换到从属，与 Elmo ESS 系统同步，可选：准备好进行电视电影制作，遥控器：红外/有线/蓝牙。\n配件：开发兼容的循环设备，线轴臂扩展。\n我们的项目将在两年半的时间内进行，并计划在 2025 年 9 月完成，届时将在鹿特丹的 Back To The Future Festival 上展示原型。作为第一步，我们两人团队拆卸了四款电影放映机模型，我们发现这些模型提供了适合进一步开发的机械系统。我们确定了三个需要与不同专家合作的开发领域：光源、胶片输送机制和电子设备。但在我们采取下一步之前，我们也意识到我们正处于一个需要决定走哪条路的十字路口：\nA. 开发一个灵活的升级系统，适用于各种现有的放映机型号。这将确保艺术家能够升级他们自己的放映机型号，无论他们住在哪里，拥有什么放映机。我们的担忧是，开发能够适应各种现有机械部件的部件可能很困难。\nB. 仅为一种广泛可用的放映机型号开发升级系统。这将使我们能够开发更具体的部件，并为该型号创建一个集成概念。缺点是，许多放映机型号在世界各地并不同样可用。\nC. 开发一个 DIY 套件，复制各种现有型号的机械部件，使用 3D 打印、CNC 和激光切割等技术。这将使全球的艺术家能够从头开始构建自己的模块化和最先进的放映机。最终，我们可以提供和运输那些难以单独生产的现成部件。\n一旦这个关键决定做出，我们希望聘请一位机电专家加入项目，陪伴项目直到原型完成。同时，我们希望建立一个在线社区，与他们分享我们的想法，他们也可以测试和改进各个部件。我们已经与几位独立进行类似开发的人士取得联系，他们正等待最终分享他们的知识和经验。最后，我们将聘请一位工业设计师与我们合作，以构建一个原型。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44340386\n有人赞赏该项目保留了 16mm/35mm 胶片的兴趣，并尝试解决一些问题，尤其是转向可调光 LED 和开源/3D 打印部件。\n有人提出 16mm/35mm 胶片正在逐渐消失，每年因胶片变质或丢失而减少，认为项目应该简化，专注于制作一个基本的开源投影仪。\n有人提到尽管 35mm 胶片在一些城市仍有市场，但 35mm 胶片的存储和运输成本使得放映不太经济。\n有人回忆起自己作为放映员的经历，对老式机器有深厚的感情，并认为数字投影仪的普及使得胶片放映变得罕见。\n有人指出老式胶片在色彩保持方面比老式投影仪更好，这改变了人们对老式 16mm 投影色彩褪色的看法。\n有人提到该项目对于电影保存领域很重要，可能标志着该领域运作方式的重大转变。\n有人表示这是一个很棒的项目，作为嵌入式工程师，希望能早点知道并参与其中。\n有人提到自己有很多 8mm 和 16mm 胶片需要存档，认为这可能是开源胶片扫描仪的好起点。\n有人提到 8mm 胶片扫描仪很常见，但如果想要从边缘到边缘扫描 8mm 胶片并获得每帧的 TIFFs 或类似格式，情况就不同了。\n有人警告说，使用 AOI CPU 散热器用于其他目的时要小心，因为它们是封闭单元，容易蒸发和空气渗透，且重新填充困难。\n有人对该项目的散热方案表示怀疑，认为 800 瓦特的功率通过一个双风扇散热器可能不足以应对高温环境。\n#\n\n\n  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/ai-is-ushering-in-the-tiny-team-era-in-silicon-valley\n在硅谷的创业环境中，随着人工智能（AI）的发展，创业公司的运作模式正在发生显著变化。从之前的 “快速扩张”（blitzscaling）时代，即 2012 年 Facebook 上市到 2023 年 WeWork 破产期间，创业公司通常重视市场估值和融资总额，尤其是追求 “独角兽” 身份（即估值达到 10 亿美元）。而如今，越来越多的创业者开始重视员工人均收入这一新指标，这被视为成功的新的 “圣杯”。\n随着 AI 助手、顾问、程序员和市场营销工具的崛起，创业者们能够在保持低人力成本的同时，实现更高效的增长。OpenAI 的 CEO Sam Altman 曾表示，未来可能出现单人即可达到十亿美元估值的公司，这在过去是难以想象的。Flybridge Capital Partners 的合伙人 Jeffrey Bussgang 强调，这种现象可以称之为 “在不扩张的扩展”（scaling without growing），即 “机器人扩展”（botscaling）取代了传统的 “快速扩张”。\nAI 的进步使得创业者能够利用人工智能进行编码、市场研究、营销、以及初步的商业构想。越来越多的创业者开始依赖 AI 作为 “联合创始人”，以便在资源有限的情况下，快速进行产品开发和市场验证。例如，创业公司 Portrait 的联合创始人 Roo Harrigan 表示，AI 使他们能够迅速生成产品原型，而不必依赖传统的技术合作伙伴。\n在创业过程中，AI 不仅能够充当工具，还可以扮演 “数字合伙人” 或 “导师” 的角色。研究表明，利用 AI 的个人在产生创意方面的表现，甚至可以与没有 AI 的团队相媲美，且团队使用 AI 的表现更优。\n尽管 AI 能在很多方面取代人力，创业者仍需保持人类的判断力与决策能力。许多创业者开始尝试使用 AI 来提升决策效率，例如通过 AI 预测不同商业决策的成功几率。然而，AI 的局限性仍然存在，它在某些情况下表现良好，而在其他情况下则不尽如人意，形成了所谓的 “锯齿状前沿”（jagged frontier）。因此，创业者需要不断探索 AI 的优势与不足，以便合理分配任务。\n最后，文章探讨了在 AI 高度发展的未来，是否会出现完全由 AI 运营的公司。虽然当前 AI 仍然面临许多限制，但随着技术的进步，完全由 AI 主导的创业公司可能成为现实。这要求创业者在利用 AI 的同时，找到平衡点，确保 AI 能更好地理解和执行他们的商业愿景。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44339596\nAI 技术提高了个人开发效率，使得小团队能完成以往需要更多人力的项目。\n历史上，技术进步如 Rails 框架已经使得小团队的效率大幅提升。\nAI 技术可能会导致小团队不再被看作等同于大团队，因为其他人也能通过 AI 提升效率。\n亚马逊和微软等大公司通过提高产出标准和使用 AI 辅助工具来应对技术变革。\n开发者可能会因为 AI 技术的发展而离开大公司，转向小公司工作。\nAI 技术使得开发人员能够快速达到“更高”的低垂果实。\n一些人通过 AI 技术能大幅提升效率，而大多数人的效率提升有限。\nAI 自动化和增强可以扩展个人的开发能力，提高项目质量。\n严格的代码规范、AI 代码生成、自动化部署和测试等技术可以加速开发流程。\nAI 辅助可以快速生成 ETL 代码，但仍然需要人工进行领域研究和需求收集。\nAI 技术可能会让开发者花费更多时间在工具选择和学习上，而不是实际工作。\n选择 AI 工具时应考虑避免锁定，确保项目可以在命令行中构建、测试和运行。\n通过尝试和比较不同 AI 工具，可以找到适合自己的编辑器和 API。\n#\n\n\n  https://github.com/lfnoise/sapf\n这个网页介绍了一个名为“Sound As Pure Form”（简称 sapf）的项目，它是一个用于音频合成的 Forth 风格的语言。sapf 使用懒加载列表和类似 APL 的自动映射功能。以下是对网页主体内容的详细中文摘要：\n项目介绍：\nsapf 是一个解释器，用于创建和转换声音。\n该语言主要是功能性的，基于栈，使用后缀表示法，类似于 FORTH。\n它使用懒加载的可能无限的序列来表示音频和控制事件。\nsapf 的目标是为懒加载序列提供高级函数，具有普遍的自动映射、扫描和归约操作符，类似于 APL 对数组的处理。\n这使得 sapf 成为一个简短程序就能实现与其大小不成比例的结果的语言。\n由于几乎所有程序员可访问的数据类型都是不可变的，因此该语言可以轻松地运行多个线程，而不会出现死锁或数据损坏。\n灵感来源：\n启发 sapf 的其他语言包括 APL、Joy、Haskell、Piccola、Nyquist 和 SuperCollider。\nAPL 和 FORTH（Joy 衍生自 FORTH）因其奇特的符号或语法而广受诟病，但还没有一种语言能像 APL 或其衍生语言那样具有简洁的表达力。\nAPL 之所以强大，并非因为其奇怪的符号或语法，而是因为它自动将操作映射到数组上，并允许在数组内部进行深度迭代。\nAlan Perlis 关于 APL 的名言也反映了对这种编程方式的兴趣，即通过 APL 可能开始获得我们在自然语言中所尊敬的编程维度，比如优雅的表达、简洁、诗意和艺术性。\n编程风格：\nJoy 语言引入了组合函数式编程，通常意味着基于栈的虚拟机和由函数组成的程序，这些函数接受输入栈并返回输出栈。\n后缀是自然产生的语法，后缀是可能的最小语法。\n作者喜欢组合式编程的几个原因包括：函数组合是连接、通过函数流水线传递值以获得新值是最自然的习语、函数从左到右应用而不是内外、支持多返回值是免费的、不需要操作符优先级、需要的分隔符更少。\n快速设置：\n将 sapf 程序放入~/bin 或您存放命令的地方。\n由于这个二进制文件是未签名的，您需要移除苹果的隔离属性。\n在终端或您的 shell 配置文件中设置环境变量。\n例如：export SAPF_HISTORY=\"$HOME/sapf-files/sapf-history.txt\"等。\n阅读这个 README 文件，查看一些示例，启动 sapf 终端，打开 sapf-examples.txt 文本编辑器，将示例复制到命令行。\n命令行使用：\nsapf [-r sample-rate][-p prelude-file]：设置会话采样率，默认为 96000 Hz。\n-p prelude-file：在进入读取-评估-打印循环之前加载代码文件的路径。如果未提供此参数，则从环境变量 SAPF_PRELUDE 存储的路径加载前奏文件。\n-h：打印命令行帮助。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44342731\nSAPF 是一种受 Supercollider、APL 和 Forth 启发的音乐语言，其独特的 concatenative 方法非常适合创意音频 DSP 处理。\nSAPF 的设计非常精心，加入的 APL 风格函数元素与堆栈方法相得益彰。\nSAPF 的示例听起来很不错，这是一个好兆头。\n有人提议 APL 和 Forth 的粉丝（或者说数组语言和 concatenative 语言的粉丝）应该更多地合作，因为这两种范式非常互补。\nSAPF 在 Supercollider 论坛上有专门的讨论区，作者 James 偶尔会出现回答问题。\nSAPF 的作者 James McCartney 是 Supercollider 的原始作者。\n有人提到了 Glicol，这是一种硬件启发式的、所见即所得风格的懒图更新音乐语言。\n有人分享了一个在 SQL 中的乐器合成器项目 NoiSQL。\n有人觉得 SAPF 的概念非常酷，即使没有音乐语言的背景。\n有人询问是否有可能在 Linux 上编译 SAPF，因为项目看起来是基于 Xcode 和 OSX 的。\n有人提供了一个 GitHub 链接，指向一个可能的 SAPF 的 Linux 版本。\n有人提到了 TidalCycles、Strudel、Sardine、Bacalao 和 Overtone 等使用 SuperCollider 的不同方式。\n有人提出 AI 可能有助于翻译或编写翻译器。\n有人询问是否有 SAPF 的 Linux 二进制包，因为他们在 Ubuntu 上遇到了困难。\n有人推荐 Supercollider，因为它的 UI 组件在 Mac 和 Linux 上都能很好地工作。\n有人建议尝试 kxstudio，这是一个为音频工作配置 Ubuntu 或 Debian 的软件包集合。\n有人推荐了 Strudel，一个只需要浏览器的音乐语言。\n有人表示 Supercollider 在 PopOS（一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版）上可以无问题运行。\n#\n\n\n  https://mazzo.li/posts/fast-pipes.html\n这篇文章探讨了 Linux 中 Unix 管道的性能，并逐步优化了一个测试程序，该程序通过管道进行数据的写入和读取。文章从简单的程序开始，其吞吐量约为 3.5GiB/s，并将其性能提高了 20 倍。优化过程基于使用 Linux 的 perf 工具对程序进行性能分析。文章中提供的代码可以在 GitHub 上找到。\n文章首先介绍了一个性能测试程序，该程序通过管道传输数据，并展示了性能图表。作者受到一个高度优化的 FizzBuzz 程序的启发，该程序能够以大约 35GiB/s 的速度将输出推送到管道。文章的目标是达到这个速度，并在过程中解释每一步。文章还提到了一个额外的性能改进措施，这在 FizzBuzz 中并不需要，因为在作者的机器上，瓶颈实际上是计算输出，而不是 IO。\n文章的主要内容分为以下几个部分：\n一个初始的慢速版本的管道测试台；\n管道在内部是如何实现的，以及为什么从它们读写数据会很慢；\nvmsplice 和 splice 系统调用如何让我们绕过一些（但不是全部！）慢速问题；\nLinux 分页的描述，以及使用大页面的更快版本；\n最终优化，用忙循环替换轮询；\n一些结束语。\n文章的第四部分深入 Linux 内核内部，即使对于熟悉文章中讨论的其他主题的读者来说，也可能很有趣。对于不熟悉这些主题的读者，文章假设他们至少具备基本的 C 语言知识。\n文章首先测量了传说中的 FizzBuzz 程序的性能，并遵循 StackOverflow 帖子中规定的规则。FizzBuzz 程序以 36GiB/s 的速度产生输出。作者的机器上的 L2 缓存是 256KiB，文章中的程序也将输出 256KiB 的数据块，但不会进行任何“计算”。作者尝试测量合理缓冲大小的程序写入管道的上限。\n文章提供了 write.cpp 和 read.cpp 两个程序的代码，分别用于写入和读取。write 程序不断写入相同的 256KiB 数据，而 read 程序读取 10GiB 数据后终止，并打印吞吐量。两个程序都接受各种命令行选项以改变它们的行为。\n使用 write 和 read 系统调用进行第一次尝试，使用与 FizzBuzz 相同的缓冲区大小。文章展示了 write 端的代码，并解释了 memset 的作用。write 调用负责所有工作，其余部分确保整个缓冲区被写入。read 端非常相似，但读取数据到缓冲区，并在读取足够数据后终止。\n文章通过 perf 工具分析了程序的耗时，并发现大部分时间都花在了 pipe_write 上，这是 write 调用解析到的，如果我们正在写入管道。在 pipe_write 中，3/4 的时间用于复制或分配页面。为了完全理解发生了什么，我们需要首先了解管道是如何工作的。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44344708\nLinux 管道在 Windows 上的性能表现不佳，尤其是在等待连接时\nWindows 后来添加了 AF_UNIX 套接字，可能性能更好\nPOSIX 只定义行为，不定义性能，每个平台和操作系统都有自己的性能特点\nPOSIX 无法定义管道这样的性能\n在 Linux 上，splice()是最快最有效的管道数据传输方式，特别是在大量数据传输时\n在 BSD 系统上，readv()/writev()可能是最高效的方式\nsendfile()在 Linux 和 BSD 上都具有高性能，但只支持文件到套接字的传输\n在 Linux 上，sendfile()使用 splice 实现，可以用于文件到块设备的传输\nNetflix 曾因 FreeBSD 的 sendfile 性能优越而使用它作为内容服务器\n使用共享内存和文件描述符传递可以更快且完全可移植\n现代 Linux 是否有类似于 Doors 的技术，用于低延迟的数据交换\nAF_UNIX 可能在音频应用中不够低延迟\n共享内存提供最低延迟，但需要处理任务唤醒，通常通过 futexs 实现\nGoogle 曾研究 FUTEX_SWAP 调用，允许任务间直接交接，但不清楚进展如何\n文章讨论了 splice 的安全影响和 ABI 破坏，询问 splice 是否有长期保留计划\n询问是否可以将默认管道修改为总是使用 splice 以提高性能",

    "url": "https://juejin.cn/post/7518343357765124136",
    "description": "🎉 unibest 3.0 发布了！看看都更新了啥好用的功能~\n大家好，我是菲鸽，昨天周六（2025-06-21）肝了一整天，实现了我一直想实现但是没时间实现的功能：多个 tabbar 相关的分支统一成一个。\nv3.0 之前，主要分支有 base、tabbar、spa、i18n 等，其中前3个分支都是跟底部的 tabbar 导航栏相关的，于是我在琢磨能否将他们合并成一个分支，通过不同策略来实现，现在终于实现了。\n新实现的 tabbar 导航栏有4种不同的策略，分别对应 0,1,2,3：\n0 完全原生 tabbar，使用 switchTab 切换 tabbar，tabbar 页面有缓存。\n\n优势：原生自带的 tabbar，最先渲染，有缓存。\n劣势：只能使用 2 组图片来切换选中和非选中状态，修改颜色只能重新换图片（或者用 iconfont）。\n1 半自定义 tabbar，使用 switchTab 切换 tabbar，tabbar 页面有缓存。使用了第三方 UI 库的 tabbar 组件，并隐藏了原生 tabbar 的显示。\n\n优势：可以随意配置自己想要的 svg icon，切换字体颜色方便。有缓存。可以实现各种花里胡哨的动效等。\n劣势：首次点击 tababr 会闪烁。\n2 全自定义 tabbar，使用 navigateTo 切换 tabbar，tabbar 页面无缓存。使用了第三方 UI 库的 tabbar 组件。\n\n优势：可以随意配置自己想要的 svg icon，切换字体颜色方便。可以实现各种花里胡哨的动效等。\n劣势：首次点击 tababr 会闪烁，无缓存。\n3 无 tabbar，只有一个页面入口，底部无 tabbar 显示；常用语临时活动页。\n代码层面的修改也很简单，只需要修改 selectedTabbarStrategy 为对应的策略数值，然后对应配置 tabbarList 即可。关键代码如下：\n/**\n * tabbar 选择的策略，更详细的介绍见 tabbar.md 文件\n * 0: 'NATIVE_TABBAR'  `完全原生 tabbar`\n * 2: 'FULL_CUSTOM_TABBAR' `全自定义 tabbar`\n * 1: 'HALF_CUSTOM_TABBAR' `半自定义 tabbar`\n * 3: 'NO_TABBAR' `无 tabbar`\n *\n * 温馨提示：本文件的任何代码更改了之后，都需要重新运行，否则 pages.json 不会更新导致错误\n */\n\n// TODO：通过这里切换使用tabbar的策略\nexport const selectedTabbarStrategy = 0\n\n// selectedTabbarStrategy==0 时，需要填 iconPath 和 selectedIconPath\n// selectedTabbarStrategy==1 or 2 时，需要填 icon 和 iconType\n// selectedTabbarStrategy==3 时，tabbarList 不生效\nexport const tabbarList = [\n  {\n    iconPath: 'static/tabbar/home.png',\n    selectedIconPath: 'static/tabbar/homeHL.png',\n    pagePath: 'pages/index/index',\n    text: '首页',\n    icon: 'home',\n    iconType: 'uiLib',\n  },\n  {\n    iconPath: 'static/tabbar/example.png',\n    selectedIconPath: 'static/tabbar/exampleHL.png',\n    pagePath: 'pages/about/about',\n    text: '关于',\n    icon: 'i-carbon-code',\n    // 注意 unocss 的图标需要在 页面上引入一下，或者配置到 unocss.config.ts 的 safelist 中\n    iconType: 'unocss',\n  },\n  // {\n  //   pagePath: 'pages/my/index',\n  //   text: '我的',\n  //   icon: '/static/logo.svg',\n  //   iconType: 'local',\n  // },\n  // {\n  //   pagePath: 'pages/mine/index',\n  //   text: '我的',\n  //   icon: 'iconfont icon-my',\n  //   iconType: 'iconfont',\n  // },\n]\n\n非常简单，注意修改完后需要重新运行，以便生成新的 pages.json，否则还是旧的。\n因为有重大分支变更，所以升级了主版本号，从 v2.15.0 升级到了 v3.0.0。\n详细说说分支变更情况\n把 base、tabbar、spa 合并成了新的 base 分支，并改名为 main 分支。\n原本的 main 分支是文档相关的，已经拆分出去了，在文档的仓库。\n代码仓库：github.com/unibest-tec…\n文档仓库：github.com/unibest-tec…\n今天我又加上了其他几个分支，都是基于新的 main 开发的，主要是 ui 库的整理，方便用户直接生成不同 ui 库的基础模版，如下图。\n\n其他变更\nlint 格式化程序变更\n原本我是配置了超级好用的 oxlint，速度非常快，爱不释手，但是奈何他还不支持 vue 文件。对于个人项目或者小项目， oxlint +  prettier 就够了。但是对于大团队来说，还是不足的，正好有用户提了 issue，正好周末有空，那就整吧。\n正好 antfu 的 eslint/config 也确实很贴心，几乎所有文件（除了css)都能处理，引入也方便，格式化效果也不错，于是就搞进去了，除了速度慢，没啥毛病。\n我们是 uniapp 项目，所以还是用了 uni-helper 的 eslint/config，它对 antfu 的 eslint/config 进行了 uniapp 处理。至此搞定了新的 lint 工具。\n等 oxlint 支持 vue 的时候，我们会第一时间切换回来，真香。\n吐槽下， eslint 格式化时不时卡死，吐血。\nalovajs 引入\n新开了个 alovajs ，简单处理了一下，但是感觉还不是最优解，所以还不敢直接放到 main 分支中。有熟悉的大牛可以帮我搞个完备的 alovajs，目前主要是 ts 方面不足，还有上传请求的封装。欢迎PR\n肝了一天，已经接入 alovajs 了，会自动同步到各个分支。（通过github 流水线）\nalovajs 确实值得推广，文档也很用心。我果断捐赠了 50 大洋，支持开源贡献。\n也请了 alovajs 成员帮我看看我写的方式对不对，提交 PR，提高代码优雅度。\n🎉 unibest 文档地址 🎉\n新地址：unibest.tech\n旧地址：codercup.github.io/unibest-doc… （停止维护）\n我发现还是有很多网友近旧的文档地址，新地址的用户访问数还是不足旧地址。旧的文档已经不更新了，因为秘钥丢失，我进不去了。请大家使用新地址访问。\n新仓库网址是 “unibest.tech”，很好记。左上角有版本号。右上角有 github 的连接，这里进去的就是最新的 unibest 代码仓库，如下图。\n\n如上图，最底部还有 “优秀案例” 的展示，如果您有好的案例也可以在 issue: 📳 Unibest 优秀案例征集！诚邀您的参与 #139\n中填写，我会不定期整理进去。\n\n我还发现 github 的 star 数也是这样，新仓库比不上旧仓库，如上图。看来大家保存都是去年发的文章里面的仓库地址，虽然我已经把文章里面的各种地址都改了，但是之前的人估计不会再去看这些文章了，所以一直存的都是旧地址。\n嗯，好了，写得差不多了，希望 unibest 有帮到你。\n对了，最后透露一下，目前平均每天有 100+ 个 unibest项目生成。看来写 uniapp 的用户还不少，哈哈。\n记住 unibest.tech，从右上角点进去的不会错。",

    "description": "enum（枚举）是 TypeScript 中一个非常实用的语言特性，用于定义一组有名字的常量。它在 JavaScript 中并没有直接对应的原生语法，因此编译器需要将其转化为 JavaScript 可执行的形式。本文将介绍 TypeScript 中各种类型的 enum 是如何被转译成 JavaScript 代码的。\n一、普通的数字枚举（Number Enum）\nenum Direction {\n  Up,\n  Down,\n  Left,\n  Right\n}\n\n编译后的 JavaScript（ES5）代码：\nvar Direction;\n(function (Direction) {\n  Direction[Direction[\"Up\"] = 0] = \"Up\";\n  Direction[Direction[\"Down\"] = 1] = \"Down\";\n  Direction[Direction[\"Left\"] = 2] = \"Left\";\n  Direction[Direction[\"Right\"] = 3] = \"Right\";\n})(Direction || (Direction = {}));\n\n原理解析：\nTypeScript 使用 立即调用函数表达式（IIFE） 创建一个对象 Direction。\n枚举成员不仅有 从名称到数值 的映射，如 Direction.Up === 0；\n还有 从数值到名称 的反向映射，如 Direction[0] === \"Up\"。\n这就是所谓的 双向映射（Bidirectional Mapping）。\n二、带初始值的枚举\nenum Status {\n  Ok = 200,\n  NotFound = 404,\n  Error = 500\n}\n\n编译结果：\nvar Status;\n(function (Status) {\n  Status[Status[\"Ok\"] = 200] = \"Ok\";\n  Status[Status[\"NotFound\"] = 404] = \"NotFound\";\n  Status[Status[\"Error\"] = 500] = \"Error\";\n})(Status || (Status = {}));\n\n如果第一个枚举成员提供了初始值，其余成员会自动递增（如果没有指定值）。\n不影响双向映射机制。\n三、字符串枚举（String Enum）\nenum Color {\n  Red = \"RED\",\n  Green = \"GREEN\",\n  Blue = \"BLUE\"\n}\n\n编译结果：\nvar Color;\n(function (Color) {\n  Color[\"Red\"] = \"RED\";\n  Color[\"Green\"] = \"GREEN\";\n  Color[\"Blue\"] = \"BLUE\";\n})(Color || (Color = {}));\n\n注意：\n字符串枚举只生成 单向映射：Color.Red === \"RED\"；\n无法通过 Color[\"RED\"] 获取 Red，也无法做反向映射。\n四、Heterogeneous Enum（混合型枚举）\nenum Result {\n  Yes = 1,\n  No = \"NO\"\n}\n\n编译后：\nvar Result;\n(function (Result) {\n  Result[Result[\"Yes\"] = 1] = \"Yes\";\n  Result[\"No\"] = \"NO\";\n})(Result || (Result = {}));\n\n混合型枚举不是很推荐使用；\n可能会导致代码混淆，尤其是需要一致性的时候。\n五、常量枚举（const enum）\nconst enum Axis {\n  X,\n  Y,\n  Z\n}\n\nconst dir = Axis.X;\n\n编译后的 JavaScript：\nvar dir = 0 /* X */;\n\n特点：\n不生成任何枚举对象代码；\n所有对枚举成员的引用都被直接替换为对应的值；\n更适合性能敏感或体积敏感的场景；\n但是不能用于需要运行时访问枚举对象的情况。\n六、如何查看枚举转译后的 JavaScript？——使用 TypeScript Playground\n想要直观地查看 TypeScript 枚举是如何被编译为 JavaScript 的代码，可以使用 TypeScript 官方提供的在线工具 —— Playground：\n访问地址：\n👉 www.typescriptlang.org/play/\n使用方法：\n打开 Playground 页面；\n在左侧编辑器中输入你的 TypeScript 枚举代码，例如：\nenum Direction {\n  Up,\n  Down,\n  Left,\n  Right\n}\nconsole.log(Direction)\n\n右侧就会自动显示编译后的 JavaScript 代码，默认是 ES5 模式；\n\nconsole.log(Direction)的输出如下图所示：\n\n你还可以通过点击上方的 \"TS Config\" 下拉按钮，选择不同的目标版本（如 ES3、ES5、ES6）；\n如果你使用了 const enum，记得关闭 isolatedModules 或开启 preserveConstEnums 才能查看其替换行为。\n小贴士：\nPlayground 是调试 TypeScript 特性最简单有效的方式；\n除了枚举，也适用于泛型、装饰器、类型推导等各种高级语法的编译分析；\n它还能分享代码片段，只需点击右上角的 \"Share\" 按钮，即可生成链接。\n七、编译选项影响\n如果开启了 --preserveConstEnums，const enum 会保留为实际的 JavaScript 枚举对象；\n如果关闭 --isolatedModules，可以使用 const enum；\n编译为 ES6 时，枚举仍然是 var + IIFE 模式，并不会转化为 const + class 或 Map 等。\n八、小结\n\n枚举类型是否生成对象是否支持反向映射编译后体积\n\n数字枚举✅✅一般\n字符串枚举✅❌一般\nconst 枚举❌（直接替换）❌最小\n\n九、结语\nTypeScript 的 enum 设计初衷是为了增强 JavaScript 的可读性和类型安全性，但它的转译方式也让我们理解了一个类型系统是如何在不支持这些语法的 JavaScript 上运行的。选择使用哪种枚举，应当根据运行时是否需要访问枚举值、是否需要反向映射、以及最终代码的体积要求进行权衡。",

是一款免费开源的语法检查工具，专为开发者设计，强调隐私保护和离线使用。\n微软因特朗普行政命令暂停国际刑事法院检察官的电子邮件账户，暴露欧洲对美国科技公司的依赖。\n研究表明，大型语言模型在识别文档中故意遗漏的信息方面存在显著局限性。\n欧盟考虑将云服务从微软Azure转移到法国OVHcloud，以增强数字主权和减少对美国科技公司的依赖。\n一家公司通过迁移到Hetzner并使用Ansible，成功削减了90%的云服务成本，同时保持ISO 27001认证。\n研究显示，塑料袋禁令和收费政策显著减少了海岸线上的有害塑料垃圾，尤其是全面禁令效果最佳。\nDelta Chat 是一款去中心化且安全的即时通讯应用，支持多设备和多个人档案，提供端到端加密技术。\nSEGA 不慎泄露了多款热门游戏的销量数据，包括《如龙：无限财富》和《女神异闻录5皇家版》等。\n#\n\n\n  https://iter.ca/post/yt-adblock/\nYouTube 近期推出了新的反广告拦截措施。目前，这些措施正在进行 A/B 测试，作者的一个账户被分到了实验组。作者编写了一个过滤器，可以在 uBlock Origin（以及 Brave 浏览器，因为它使用相同的过滤规则）上部分绕过其中一项反广告拦截措施——假缓冲（fake buffering）。这个过滤器已经包含在默认的过滤列表中，用户不需要手动添加。\n所谓的“假缓冲”是指视频在开始时会因为多次缓冲而加载缓慢，但这种缓冲只发生在视频开始时，不会在视频播放中途出现。作者解释说，假缓冲的时间长度是你本应看到的广告长度的 80%，因此即使有假缓冲，使用广告拦截器仍然能节省时间。\n文章接着介绍了 InnerTube，这是 YouTube 的内部 API，用于客户端和移动应用与视频交互并获取视频详情。InnerTube 的端点看起来像 \n  https://www.youtube.com/youtubei/。其中一个端点是/youtubei/v1/player，当你点击视频时，网页客户端会调用这个端点来获取 URL 和 GVS 流媒体 URL 的数据。\nGVS（Google Video Services）是为 YouTube、Google Drive 和 Google Photos 提供视频流服务的平台。要从 GVS 流媒体服务中播放视频，你需要从 InnerTube（或 Drive/Photos 的内部 API）获取一个签名的、有过期时间的 GVS/videoplayback URL。GVS URL 不能自行构造，需要从 InnerTube 获取。GVS 的一个特点是，它不仅托管在谷歌的数据中心，ISP 也可以在其基础设施中放置 Google Global Cache 服务器，以便在不将流量发送到 ISP 网络外部的情况下提供 YouTube 视频（只有公开/未列出的 YouTube 视频由 GGC 提供；私有 YouTube 视频和 Drive/Photos 视频始终从谷歌数据中心提供）。GVS URL 看起来像 \n  https://rr1—sn-gvbxgn-tt1e6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1750321185&...（但有更多的查询参数）。\n最初，网页客户端通过向 GVS URL 添加一些查询参数来流式传输视频，GVS 会响应视频内容的特定范围。但出于复杂的原因，YouTube 决定通过 SABR（服务器 ABR（自适应比特率））来改进这一点，这是 YouTube 的专有二进制协议，用于流式传输视频数据，比现今的开放格式（例如 MPEG-DASH）更擅长避免缓冲。SABR 支持的一件事是服务器向客户端发送回退，指示客户端在再次尝试之前等待一段时间，而不是发送视频/音频数据。\n文章指出，假缓冲的来源是 InnerTube 提供的 GVS 流会在第一个/videoplayback 请求（针对内容视频，而不是广告）时给予 80% 的广告时长的回退。例如，如果广告是 15 秒，你在屏蔽广告时会得到 12 秒的回退。如果有一个 6 秒的不可跳过广告和一个 15 秒的不可跳过广告，回退将是 16.8 秒。需要明确的是，这不是服务器端广告插入；广告和内容流仍然是分开的（YouTube 正在进行服务器端广告插入实验，但这与假缓冲是分开的）。“遇到中断”对话框很可能是由 GVS 的长回退触发的。\n这种回退总是在 A/B 测试中发生，不管 YouTube 是否认为你在使用广告拦截器。你只是没有注意到它，如果你没有屏蔽广告，因为网页客户端在广告播放时开始加载内容视频，所以对于非广告拦截用户来说，唯一的区别是内容视频直到广告 80% 播放完毕才开始缓冲。\n作者还提到了网上的一些说法，称 YouTube“通过提高 CPU 使用率来破坏计算机，如果你使用广告拦截器”。这完全是虚假的；YouTube 在等待回退到期时并不使用 CPU（即使他们使用自旋循环来实现等待，使单个核心达到最大值 <30 秒也不会损坏任何 CPU）。\n文章最后讨论了如何避免在不可跳过广告结束后才被回退。如果你没有被提供广告，就不会被回退。如果你在播放器请求中设置 playbackContext.contentPlaybackContext.isInlinePlaybackNoAd 属性为 true，InnerTube 就不会为你提供任何广告，因此也不会在 GVS 流中包含任何回退。\n作者可以编写一个过滤规则，使得每当网页客户端将 JSON 字符串化以用于服务器请求时，我们都会在字符串化的 JSON 中添加\"isInlinePlaybackNoAd\":true。\n文章还提到了如何通过 req2proto 工具从 Google 的内部 API 中提取 protobuf 定义，以获取/youtubei/v1/player 调用中使用的完整定义，并找到 isInlinePlaybackNoAd 属性。\n这种方法只适用于热导航，即你已经加载了 YouTube 单页应用并在其中点击。当你直接导航到观看页面时，YouTube 后端会将播放器响应直接嵌入页面作为 ytInitialPlayerResponse。由于播放器请求是在后端进行的，我们无法在它上面设置 isInlinePlaybackNoAd。\n文章还讨论了如何通过移除初始数据来强制 YouTube 进行我们可以控制的球员请求，但作者警告说这是一个坏主意，因为它会完全破坏直播流，并可能影响其他未测试的功能。它还会导致视频播放器短暂闪烁，并减慢页面加载时间。\n最后，文章讨论了如何绕过锁定脚本。有时 uBlock Origin 没有钩住 JSON.stringify，作者进一步调查发现 YouTube 正在进行 A/B 测试，有时会在前端 HTML 的<head>标签中的第一项添加以下内容：\n<script id=\"bc-def\" nonce=\"[variable]\">'use strict';function a(b,c){try{Object.defineProperty(b,c,{writable:!1,configurable:!1})}catch(d){}}a(window,\"fetch\");a(window,\"JSON\");a(window.JSON,\"stringify\");a(window.JSON,\"parse\");a(window,\"Array\");a(Array.prototype,\"push\");a(Array.prototype,\"forEach\");try{const b=document.getElementById(\"bc-def\");b&&b.remove()}catch(b){};\n</script>\n\n\n这段脚本通过使用 Object.defineProperty 将一些全局对象锁定为不可写，阻止后续代码用代理改变它们的行为。因此，uBlock Origin 只能在锁定脚本之前运行时代理 JSON.stringify。在 Firefox 上，这可以通过 HTML 过滤器很容易解决——在页面开始解析之前从源 HTML 中过滤掉脚本标签。但这依赖于 Chromium 不支持的扩展 API。\n文章最后提到，目前对锁定脚本的“修复”是钩住 Object.assign 而不是 JSON.stringify。Object.assign 是另一个在请求体被获取之前处理它的函数。作者表示，如果能有一种方法实际解除锁定脚本，而不是绕过它，那将会更好。钩住 Object.assign 的过滤器更复杂，因为 uBO 的脚本片段不允许你在对象的键上替换文本。\n#\n\n\n

 https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/\n这篇文章是一封公开信，由 SMEX（一家注册在黎巴嫩的非政府组织，致力于在中东和北非推进自我调节的信息社会）写给三星，要求三星停止在西亚和北非（WANA）地区强制安装以色列创立的 AppCloud 应用程序。\n\n近期，SMEX 收到许多来自 WANA 地区用户的报告，他们对三星 A 和 M 系列智能手机上预装的 AppCloud 应用程序表示担忧。这款应用程序在用户不知情或未经同意的情况下收集敏感个人数据，无法在不损害设备安全的情况下移除，并且没有提供清晰的隐私实践信息。\nAppCloud 是由有争议的以色列公司 ironSource（现为美国公司 Unity 所有）开发的，它被嵌入到在法律上有此类关联的国家销售的设备中。尽管存在严重的隐私和安全风险，三星并未提供关于 AppCloud 如何运作、收集哪些数据或为何用户无法选择退出的透明度。\n公开信要求三星立即提供透明度、承担责任，并进行对话。用户有权知道他们的设备上安装了什么，以及他们的数据如何被使用，尤其是在以色列在该地区进行间谍活动的情况下。\n信件中提到，自 2022 年三星与 ironSource 合作扩大以来，AppCloud 已成为在该地区分发的新 A 和 M 设备上默认嵌入的软件。根据分析，这款侵入性软件与设备的操作系统深度集成，普通用户几乎无法在不获取 root 权限的情况下卸载它，这会违反保修并带来安全风险。即使禁用了这款软件，它也可能在系统更新后重新出现。\nAppCloud 的隐私政策不透明，用户对收集的数据和使用方式一无所知，也没有直接的退出机制。该软件收集包括生物识别信息、IP 地址、设备指纹在内的敏感用户数据。AppCloud 的安装未经用户同意，违反了欧盟 GDPR 规定和 WANA 地区国家的相关数据保护法律。\nAppCloud 由以色列创立的 ironSource 开发（现由美国公司 Unity 收购），在以色列公司被禁止运营的国家（如黎巴嫩）引发了额外的法律和道德问题。ironSource 因其在用户同意和数据隐私方面的可疑做法而声名狼藉。\n三星的服务条款提到了第三方应用程序，但没有特别提及 AppCloud 或 ironSource，尽管这款软件被授予了显著的数据访问和控制权。\n强制安装 AppCloud 侵犯了中东和北非地区及以外用户的隐私和安全权利。鉴于三星在该地区的重要市场份额，对个人数据缺乏透明度和控制尤其令人震惊。\n鉴于这些担忧，SMEX 恭敬地请求三星：\n披露 AppCloud 的完整隐私政策和数据处理实践，使所有用户都能轻松获取这些信息。\n提供一个简单有效的方法，让用户可以退出 AppCloud 并从他们的设备中移除它，而不损害设备功能或保修。\n为在 WANA 地区所有 A 和 M 系列设备上预装 AppCloud 的决定提供清晰解释。\n根据《世界人权宣言》第 12 条确立的隐私权，重新考虑未来设备上继续预装 AppCloud 的决定。\nSMEX 还请求与相关三星团队会面，详细讨论这些问题，并更好地了解公司在 WANA 地区对用户隐私和数据保护的方法。SMEX 期待您的及时回应，并期待共同努力确保所有三星用户的隐私和安全。\n#\n\n\n

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/technology/us-tech-europe-microsoft-trump-icc.html\n这篇文章探讨了美国前总统特朗普如何可能利用美国的科技优势来影响欧洲，以及这种情况所引发的担忧。文章开头提到，微软在特朗普于 2025 年 2 月发布的行政命令后，迅速暂停了国际刑事法院（I.C.C.）检察官卡里姆・汗的电子邮件账户。卡汗正在调查以色列的战争罪行，这一行为引发了欧洲政界的震惊。\n文章指出，I.C.C. 的总部位于荷兰，长期以来与微软合作，依赖其提供的数字服务。特朗普的命令打乱了这一关系，令许多欧洲政策制定者意识到美国科技公司在全球范围内的影响力以及他们对美国政府政策的脆弱性。荷兰前国防部网络安全负责人巴特・格鲁特豪斯表示，这一事件使他意识到，欧洲在科技上的依赖性可能会被特朗普政府用作政治工具，进而影响盟国的独立性。\n微软在这次事件后表示，他们已与 I.C.C. 协商决定暂停卡汗的账户，但随即对其政策进行了审查和调整，以更好地保护客户免受类似的地缘政治风险。微软的总统布拉德・史密斯指出，这一事件反映了美国与欧洲之间信任的削弱。\n文章还提到，自从爱德华・斯诺登 2013 年泄露有关美国大规模监控的文件以来，欧洲国家一直在努力减少对美国科技公司的依赖。然而，由于缺乏可行的替代方案，许多机构仍依赖于美国的数字服务。数据显示，亚马逊、谷歌和微软等美国公司在欧洲的云计算市场占有率超过 70%。\n在特朗普发布命令后，微软与 I.C.C. 进行了会谈，决定继续提供其他服务，但暂停了卡汗的电子邮件账户。对于这一决策，很多人认为这将对企业和组织的合规性带来困难，因为美国政府的制裁和命令会迫使公司在商业选择中面临艰难抉择。\n为应对这种情况，欧洲各国开始探索本土技术解决方案。荷兰、丹麦和德国等国都在积极寻找减少对美国科技公司的依赖的方法。同时，欧盟也计划投入数十亿欧元在新的人工智能数据中心和云计算基础设施建设上，以增强独立性。\n总的来说，文章揭示了欧洲对美国科技主导地位的恐惧，以及在未来可能出现的更大力度的科技自主与独立的努力。许多欧洲科技公司认为，这是赢得客户、替代美国科技公司的机会，整个科技环境正在经历显著的变化。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44336915\n美国继续消耗其软实力资本以保护以色列，这位检察官因为调查以色列战争罪行而成为目标。\n以色列已经买通了所有之前的美国总统和国会议员，美国一直将以色列视为第 51 个州。\n特朗普在任期内批准将大使馆从特拉维夫迁至耶路撒冷，消耗了大量政治资本，似乎没有得到任何回报。\n1995 年通过的《耶路撒冷大使馆法案》是美国国会的法律，得到了参众两院的压倒性多数通过，特朗普只是没有像前任总统那样使用推迟搬迁的豁免权。\n特朗普可能是在对待以色列问题上与前任总统不同的一个特例。\n美国可能不再有“国家安全”的理由来推迟搬迁大使馆。\n以色列实际上并不希望大使馆搬迁，因为这引发了巴勒斯坦人的愤怒和暴力。\n耶路撒冷像冷战时期的柏林一样被分割，美国将大使馆设在西德的波恩而非柏林，搬迁到柏林将被视为侵略性举动。\n美国是否曾拒绝承认其他国家选择的首都？\n特朗普可能比前任总统更友好地对待以色列。\n特朗普的女婿兼顾问库什纳是内塔尼亚胡的个人家庭朋友，特朗普可能认为以色列是美国的一部分，他在选举中也得到了来自游说团体的大力支持。\n#\n\n\n

Holtzman\n摘要：大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越能够处理长文本输入，并在其中定位特定信息，这在“Haystack（针堆）”测试中得到了证明。然而，尽管模型在回忆惊人信息方面表现出色，它们在识别明显遗漏的信息方面仍然存在困难。我们引入了 AbsenceBench，以评估 LLMs 在三个领域：数字序列、诗歌和 GitHub 拉取请求中检测缺失信息的能力。AbsenceBench 要求模型在给定原始和编辑上下文的情况下，识别文档中哪些部分被故意删除。尽管这些任务看起来简单，但我们的实验揭示了即使是像 Claude-3.7-Sonnet 这样的最新模型，也仅在平均上下文长度为 5K 令牌的情况下达到了 69.6% 的 F1 分数。我们的分析表明，这种糟糕的表现源于一个根本性限制：Transformer 注意力机制无法轻易地关注文档中的“空白”，因为这些缺失并不对应于可以被关注的任何特定键。总体而言，我们的结果和分析提供了一个案例研究，即模型在某些任务（如 NIAH）中已经超越人类，而在某些任务（如 AbsenceBench）中却意外崩溃。\n评论：论文共有 23 页，包含 8

进行深入的商业谈判，计划将其云服务从微软转移到 OVHcloud。这一基础设施转变是由推动欧洲在云市场实现数字主权的努力所驱动的，此前一项美国行政命令导致微软服务对一家欧洲机构的员工关闭，引发了担忧。此举的目标是确保欧洲机构对其数字基础设施和数据拥有更大的控制权，这一理念得到了 EuroStack 倡议的支持。这对美国科技巨头微软来说是一个打击，该公司在过去几周一直在努力安抚其欧洲客户。\n一旦欧洲委员会“整理好自家事务”，预计它将为国家公共行政部门树立一个先例，将公共采购资金投向本土云服务提供商。委员会认为自己是一个趋势的引领者，这与其增强欧盟数字自主权和减少对非欧洲科技巨头依赖的更广泛战略相一致。据了解，委员会已经与 OVHcloud 进行了数周的讨论。然而，包括德国的 IONOS、法国的 Scaleway 和意大利的 Aruba 在内的其他一些欧洲云服务提供商也被视为潜在的替代选择。\n这种情况的独特之处在于，这是首次由一位负责技术主权组合的委员（Henna Virkkunen）监督委员会的两个关键数字部门——起草和执行数字政策的 DG CNECT 和 IT 部门 DG DIGIT。这种整合使得欧洲执行机构的政治和技术优先事项更容易协调，消息人士告诉我们。\nOVHcloud 的发言人在接受 Euractiv 评论时表示：“讨论确实正在进行中，既与委员会进行，也与其他正在评估迁移到主权云项目的公共和私人机构和组织进行。”委员会发言人回应 Euractiv 的评论请求时表示，委员会“一直在扫描市场”，并且“已经与 OVHcloud

认证的同时，从 AWS 迁移到欧洲云服务提供商，以降低成本并遵守数据保护法规。文章的主要内容包括：\n合规性和成本问题：作者提到，尽管 AWS 提供了强大的 ISO 27001 认证服务，但美国云服务提供商无法完全保护欧洲客户数据免受美国政府管辖。这违反了 GDPR 的规定，并且作者对每年 24,000 美元的 AWS 账单感到不成比例。\n战略风险：作者质疑将公司的未来与单一的美国云服务提供商绑定是否是一个负责任的选择。\n迁移到欧洲云服务提供商的好处：通过迁移到欧洲的云服务提供商，如 Hetzner 和 OVHcloud，作者获得了真正的数据主权，云成本降低了 90%，并且被迫进行创新，建立了更强大的基础设施。\n迁移策略和教训：文章分享了作者的迁移策略和从中学到的宝贵经验，包括使用 Ansible 作为合规引擎，建立与 ISO 27001 Annex A 控制直接相关的服务器配置，以及使用 Prometheus、Grafana 和 Loki 进行监控，以替代 AWS 的 CloudWatch。\n业务转型：这次迁移不仅是一个技术项目，也是一次业务转型。作者通过减少对美国监控法律的合规风险，将欧洲托管作为销售工具，增强了品牌信任，并将 90% 的云支出返还给业务。\n迁移策略是否适合你：文章最后，作者提供了一个迁移策略，帮助其他 CTO 和创始人面对类似的挑战。作者提供一小时的会议，讨论当前 AWS 设置与欧洲替代方案的成本分析，特定情况下的关键合规和 ISO 27001 风险，以及潜在迁移计划的实际时间表和前三个步骤。\n文章最后，作者邀请有兴趣探索这一策略的公司通过 LinkedIn 联系他，或直接在他的 Calendly

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp9274\n这篇文章是关于塑料购物袋禁令和费用对减少海岸线上塑料垃圾的影响的研究。文章由 Anna Papp 和 Kimberly L. Oremus 撰写，发表在《Science》杂志上，日期为 2025 年 6 月 19 日。\n引言：\n塑料污染已成为全球性问题，占据了海洋垃圾的大部分，对野生动物和生态系统构成威胁。塑料购物袋是海洋垃圾中最常见和最麻烦的类别之一，它们经常通过风力飘走而逃避废物管理，可能会缠绕或阻塞海洋动物的消化系统。全球已有超过 100 个国家通过了塑料购物袋禁令和费用政策。尽管研究表明这些政策可以在某些情况下减少塑料消费，但它们在减少环境中塑料垃圾方面的有效性尚未得到系统评估。\n研究理由：\n塑料购物袋政策是否能够减少海岸线垃圾取决于它如何影响消费和废物管理。例如，部分禁令可能无法减少塑料消费，但如果顾客用不太可能被风吹走的厚塑料袋替换薄塑料袋，仍然可以减少垃圾。或者，如果最有可能成为垃圾的袋子被排除在禁令之外，它可能会减少消费但不会减少垃圾。为了直接测量政策对环境中塑料垃圾的影响，研究者利用了 2017 年至 2023 年间在美国各地采纳的数百个州和地方塑料袋政策，结合了超过 45,000 次海岸线清理活动中的众包公民科学数据，参与者计算并分类了他们发现的物品。\n研究结果：\n尽管在研究期间塑料购物袋在清理物品中的比例总体上有所增加，但在有袋子政策的地区增加的幅度明显较小。研究发现，塑料购物袋政策导致塑料购物袋占总收集物品的比例比没有政策的地区减少了 25% 到 47%。这种相对减少在政策实施后随时间增长，没有反弹或溢出效应的证据。全面禁止塑料袋和收费都能减少塑料垃圾，而部分禁令由于对厚塑料袋的豁免，导致最小和最不精确的效果。所有地理尺度的政策都是有效的，州级政策最为稳健。袋子政策在沿海和河流地区产生类似的效果，有迹象表明在湖泊地区的效果更大。它们在塑料购物袋垃圾最普遍的地方产生最大影响。最后，研究发现在有塑料购物袋政策的地区，纠缠动物的出现减少了 30% 到 37%，尽管不能完全排除零效应的可能性。\n结论：\n研究结果表明，塑料购物袋政策在限制但未能完全消除以前普遍存在的海岸线塑料购物袋垃圾方面普遍有效。如果分析中使用的样本具有代表性，那么扩大塑料袋禁令或收费将继续减少塑料购物袋垃圾，并可能与业务常态相比减少野生动物纠缠。在废物产生预计增加的情况下，塑料碎片进入水域仍将是一个重要的全球问题，除非发生大规模的政策转变。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44333187\n塑料禁令和收费减少了海岸线上有害的塑料袋垃圾。\n加州的塑料禁令导致更重、更难降解的“可重复使用”塑料袋使用增加，可能导致海滩上微塑料增加。\n瑞典的塑料袋禁令有效减少了塑料袋和塑料垃圾，禁令解除后效果持续。\n澳大利亚的塑料袋禁令中，许多额外付费的袋子是纸质的。\n需要禁止一次性餐具和大部分一次性塑料食品包装，通过征税减少塑料垃圾。\n应该只针对有塑料替代品或至少塑料使用较少的产品实施禁令。\n应该对不耐用的塑料产品征税，以减少塑料垃圾。\n聚乙烯很少含有塑化剂，不会硬化或开裂，除非持续暴露在阳光下。\n过去的镀锌桶含有铅，并非所有过去的产品都比现代的好。\n塑料垃圾的外部成本应该通过征税来弥补，而镀锌金属则不需要。\n通过提高塑料物品的税收来减少塑料污染，但担心税收最终不会被用于减少塑料污染。\n争论哪种袋子对环境更糟是浪费时间，因为乱扔垃圾才是根本问题，应该通过罚款和执法来解决。\n即使总质量相同，100 个旧的一次性薄塑料袋可能比 5 个可重复使用的塑料袋产生更多的微塑料。\n#\n\n\n  https://delta.chat/en/\nDelta Chat 是一个去中心化且安全的即时通讯应用。\n可靠的即时通讯功能，支持多个人资料和多设备使用。Delta Chat

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44335038\nSega 误将热门游戏销量数据泄露，Persona 5 Royal 销量达 725 万，但 Sega 仍将其视为小众动漫副业。\nSega Sammy 的内容业务仅占公司总收入的三分之一，包括所有游戏、动漫、授权协议等。\n有人开玩笑提到 SonicTax（音速税务）软件，想象 Sonic 成为税务软件角色。\n有人怀念 90 年代 Sonic 的辉煌时期。\nSega 已经推出了多种 Persona 5 衍生游戏，包括地牢探险、节奏游戏、砍杀游戏、战术游戏和手机游戏，以及 TV 动画和漫画。\n有人期待 Persona 6 的发布。\nSega 的模式是精心设计主要游戏，不急于推出，一旦 Persona 6 发布，其他工作室可以制作衍生作品来赚取大钱。\n有人提到 Metaphor 游戏作为等待 Persona 6 期间的绝佳消遣。\n有人对 Persona 6 如何超越前作表示怀疑，认为 P5R 作为游戏有些薄弱，尤其是与其他回合制游戏相比。\n有人提到 P5R 是一个漫长的游戏，不要求玩家在社交属性或角色友谊上做出选择，新游戏 Plus 模式因为游戏太长而变得难以想象。\n有人提到过去在 PS Vita 时代有很多游戏的 NG+ 模式非常有趣，如 Akiba’s Trip 2 和 Neptunia 系列。\n有人建议不要给 Sega 任何将 Sonic 变成税务会计师的想法。\n有人抱怨使用某些网站时广告太多，影响体验。\n有人推荐使用 Adguard DNS 来屏蔽广告，使得网站变得可用。\n有人指出，除了自己之外，其他人都在使用广告拦截器。\n有人指出，文档红 action 的失败尝试是这个故事的真正重点，这种情况经常发生。\n有人分享了自己在工作中利用不良红 action 技术赚钱的经历。\n有人提出，将文档数字化红 action 后打印在纸上再扫描可能是最可靠的方法。\n有人提到，使用特定类型的墨水可能会导致红 action 文本的反射率略有不同，从而留下可以用于重建文本的人工制品。\n有人回忆起一个在图像中红 action 的技巧，通过使用两种不同的黑色来隐藏信息。",

    "url": "https://juejin.cn/post/7517915625136586787",
    "description": "上线前两个月，我们的权限系统崩了三次。\n不是接口没权限，而是：\n页面展示和真实权限不一致；\n权限判断写得四分五裂；\n权限数据和按钮逻辑耦合得死死的，测试一改就炸。\n于是，我们老老实实把整个权限体系拆了重构，从接口到路由、到组件、到 v-permission 指令，走了一遍完整的流程。\n结果：代码可维护，调试容易，后端调整也能快速兜底。\n这篇文章不讲理论，只还原我们项目真踩过的 3 套失败方案和最终落地方案。\n❌ 第一套：按钮级权限直接写死在模板里\n当时我们的写法是这样的：\n<!-- 用户管理页 -->\n<el-button v-if=\"authList.includes('user:add')\">添加用户</el-button>\n\n接口返回的是一个权限数组：\n[\"user:add\", \"user:delete\", \"user:list\"]\n\n然后整个项目几十个地方都这么判断。\n结果：\n不能重用，每个组件都判断一次；\n权限粒度变更就全崩，比如从 user:add 改成 user:add_user；\n后端权限更新后，前端要全局搜索权限 key 改代码；\n典型的“写起来爽，维护时哭”方案。\n❌ 第二套：用 router.meta.permission 统一控制，结果太抽象\n重构后我们尝试统一控制页面级权限：\n// router.ts\n{\n  path: '/user',\n  component: User,\n  meta: {\n    permission: 'user:list'\n  }\n}\n\n再通过导航守卫：\nrouter.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {\n  const p = to.meta.permission\n  if (p && !authList.includes(p)) {\n    return next('/403')\n  }\n  next()\n})\n\n这个方案页面级权限是解决了，但组件级 / 按钮级 / 表单字段级全都失效了。\n而且你会发现，大量页面是“同路由但不同内容区域权限不同”，导致这种 meta.permission 方案显得太粗暴。\n❌ 第三套：封装权限组件，结果被吐槽“反人类”\n当时我们团队有人设计了一个组件：\n<Permission code=\"user:add\">\n  <el-button>添加用户</el-button>\n</Permission>\n\n这个组件内部逻辑是：\nconst slots = useSlots()\nif (!authList.includes(props.code)) return null\nreturn slots.default()\n\n结果：\n逻辑上看似没问题，但使用非常反直觉；\n特别是嵌套多个组件时，调试麻烦，断点打不进真实组件；\nTypeScript 报类型错误，编辑器无法识别 slot 类型；\n更麻烦的是，权限失效的时候，组件不会渲染，开发环境都看不到是为什么！\n最终方案：hook + 指令 + 路由统一层级设计\n我们最后把权限体系重构为 3 层：\n🔹1. 接口统一管理权限 key → 后端返回精简列表（扁平权限）\nexport type AuthCode =\n  | 'user:add'\n  | 'user:delete'\n  | 'user:edit'\n  | 'order:export'\n  | 'dashboard:view'\n\n服务端返回用户权限集，保存在 authStore（Pinia / Vuex / Context）中。\n🔹2. 统一 Hook 调用：usePermission(code)\nimport { useAuthStore } from '@/store/auth'\n\nexport function usePermission(code: string): boolean {\n  const store = useAuthStore()\n  return store.permissionList.includes(code)\n}\n\n用法：\n<el-button v-if=\"usePermission('user:add')\">添加用户</el-button>\n\n这才是真正组件内部逻辑干净、容易复用、TS 支持的方案。\n🔹3. 封装一个 v-permission 指令（可选）\napp.directive('permission', {\n  mounted(el, binding) {\n    const authList = getUserPermissions() // 从全局 store 获取\n    if (!authList.includes(binding.value)) {\n      el.remove()\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n模板中使用：\n<el-button v-permission=\"'order:export'\">导出订单</el-button>\n\n适合动态组件、render 生成的按钮，不适合复杂嵌套逻辑，但实际项目中效果拔群。\n🧪 页面级权限怎么做？\n不再用 router.meta，而是把每个路由页封装为权限包裹组件：\n<template>\n  <PermissionView code=\"dashboard:view\">\n    <Dashboard />\n  </PermissionView>\n</template>\n\n权限组件内部处理：\n没权限 → 自动跳转 403\n有权限 → 渲染内容\n这样即使权限接口变了，组件逻辑也统一保留，避免页面空白或者闪跳。\n权限这事，不是实现难，而是维护难。\n最核心的不是你怎么控制显示，而是权限 key 的一致性、复用性、分层能力。\n最终我们稳定版本满足了：\n页面、按钮、字段统一接入权限\n新增权限点只需要改枚举，不需要大改\n新人接手也能一眼看懂逻辑，能调试\n📌 你可以继续看我的系列文章\n《用了三年 Vue，我终于理解为什么“组件设计”才是重灾区》\n《我为什么觉得 React 正在逐渐失去吸引力？》\n《为什么越来越多 Vue 项目用起了 UnoCSS？》\n《为什么我放弃使用 Pinia？》\n《为什么我不再相信 Tailwind？三个月重构项目教会我的事》",

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44323253\n作者使用 Elixir 编写了一个新的 BitTorrent tracker，并提供了 Docker 镜像以便快速尝试。\n尽管有人认为 tracker 是过去的产物，但作者认为它们在现代互联网中仍有其用途。\n作者计划继续开发，并添加一些可选的高级功能。\n有人建议作者学习如何使用 OTP 设计服务，推荐了相关书籍。\n作者回应称，虽然最初尝试了 OTP 风格，但为了提高扩展性，选择了当前的设计。\n有人认为使用 ETS（Erlang Term Storage）是可以接受的，因为它是一个内置于 OTP 的内存存储系统。\n有人对“OTP-first”设计表示好奇，并质疑使用 ETS 是否不符合“OTP-first”原则。\n有人分享了学习 Elixir 后对编程思维的影响，包括状态隔离、无共享数据、失败和重启、模式匹配、结构体优于类、管道等。\n有人建议使用 Logger 和 Telemetry 应用程序，而不是直接使用 IO.puts，并考虑添加 OTel。\n作者回应称，除了表格打印外，项目中使用了 Logger，并且 Telemetry 可选地以 Prometheus 和 HTML 格式提供。\n有人询问作者最喜欢的 OTel sink 是什么。\n有人表示正在使用 Elixir 构建一个出色的通知引擎，并认为 Elixir 非常适合这项工作。\n有人询问这个通知引擎是私有的还是开源的，并表示 Elixir 需要一个更好的通知引擎。\n有人回应称，使用 Phoenix 的 PubSub 实现通知引擎是很容易的，并且已经经过了实战测试。\n有人提到了 Knock.app，这是一个用 Elixir 构建的通知引擎。\n有人询问 DHT 和 PEX 是什么，有人提供了维基百科链接进行解释。\n有人解释说 DHT 和 PEX 允许 torrent 客户端在没有中央 tracker 的情况下找到 peer。\n有人指出，尽管有了 DHT 和 PEX，但在连接到网络时仍然需要一些中央节点。\n有人澄清说，这些中央节点仅在初始的 peer 发现阶段起作用，之后 peer 可以自行找到 torrent 群组。\n有人提到，如果连接到 DHT 网络，就不需要中央服务器，除非是为了 DNS 等。\n有人提出，即使有数百万的 bootstrap 节点，也可以通过嵌入 torrent 文件或使用 SRV DNS 记录等方式找到它们。\n有人讨论了如何找到 IPv6 的 bootstrap 节点，提出了一些可能的方法。\n#\n\n\n  https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/\n这篇文章由 Elixir 的 Phoenix 框架的创造者 Chris McCord 撰写，介绍了他在 Fly.io 公司进行的一个秘密项目——Phoenix.new。Phoenix.new 是一个为 Elixir 和 Phoenix 量身定制的全在线编码代理，旨在成为构建协作、实时应用程序的最快方式。\n\n文章首先介绍了 Phoenix.new 的特点。Phoenix.new 完全在浏览器中运行，为用户和代理提供了一个 root shell，在一个临时的虚拟机（Fly Machine）中，代理可以自由地安装软件和运行程序，而不会破坏用户的本地机器。用户只需打开 VSCode 界面，点击 shell 按钮，即可进入与 Phoenix.new 代理共享的隔离机器。\n其次，Phoenix.new 是一个专为 Phoenix 设计的代理系统，Phoenix 是关于实时协作应用程序的，Phoenix.new 理解这一点。因此，Phoenix.new 在其 UI 和代理工具中都包含了一个完整的浏览器。Phoenix.new 代理使用这个浏览器“无头”模式来检查自己的前端更改并与应用程序交互。由于它是一个完整的浏览器，代理可以看到真实的页面内容和 JavaScript 状态，无论是否有人操作。\n文章接着讨论了 root 访问权限带来的好处。代理以与人类开发者相同的方式构建软件，它们不精心设计 Docker 容器层，也不真正进行发布周期。代理想要弹出一个 shell 并开始工作。一个完全隔离的虚拟机意味着 Phoenix.new 可以任意地“弄脏”。如果它想要向 mix.exs 添加一个包，然后运行 mix phx.server 或 mix test 并检查输出，这是可能的。如果它想要向基础操作系统添加一个 APT 包，它也可以做到，并确保它工作。它拥有整个环境。\n文章还提到了 Phoenix.new 如何帮助开发者将应用程序在线部署。Phoenix.new 产生的应用程序从启动时就生活在云端。它们有私有的、可共享的 URL（我们检测代理生成的任何绑定端口，并在 phx.run 下提供预览 URL，集成端口转发），它们与 Github 集成，并继承了 Fly.io 的所有基础设施保护：硬件虚拟化、WireGuard 和隔离网络。\n文章最后讨论了 Phoenix.new 的未来。作者认为我们正处于开发者工作流程的巨大变革中。代理今天就可以实际工作，无论是否有人类在场。作者预测，开发的未来可能看起来更少像是打开一个 shell 并找到一个文件来编辑，而更像是进入一个 CI 环境，代理在那里全天候工作。本地开发不会消失，但大部分迭代将发生在哪里将会发生转变。作者已经使用 Phoenix.new 来分类 phoenix-core Github 问题并挑选问题来解决。他关闭笔记本电脑，喝杯咖啡，等待 PR 的到来——Phoenix.new 也知道 PR 的工作方式。我们已经开始，这个领域才刚刚开始。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44328326\nPhoenix.new 提供了一个容器化环境，允许远程代理运行而无需用户任务的批准，这被认为是一项创新。\nPhoenix.new 与 fly.io 的深度集成使得用户可以直接与产品交互，而无需通过聊天工具复制粘贴输出。\nKasm 工作区可以作为 AI 开发环境，支持远程 Docker-based Linux 桌面。\n远程代理的创新在于它允许异步代理工作流程，这对于许多人来说是新鲜的。\nPhoenix.new 的创建者表示，这是一个全球性的 Elixir 集群，跨越整个星球。\nPhoenix.new 可以被视为一个完整的开发 IDE 环境，但它更像是一个远程运行时环境，代理在这里完成工作。\nPhoenix.new 包括一个无头 Chrome 浏览器，代理可以驱动它来测试前端功能。\nPlaywright 提供了一个 MCP 服务器，可以实现类似的功能。\nPhoenix.new 不进行模型训练，只使用现有的开源或托管模型，代码被发送到这些提供商那里。\nPhoenix.new 的 UI 没有专门的无障碍测试，开发者需要指导代理进行无障碍建设或测试。\nPhoenix.new 处理第三方库的问题，代理可以通过某种方式访问库文档。\n使用 Fly API 进行环境配置的经验表明，fly-replay 在路由和代理方面发挥了重要作用。\n#\n\n\n  https://zhihaojia.medium.com/compiling-llms-into-a-megakernel-a-path-to-low-latency-inference-cf7840913c17\n这篇文章介绍了一种新开发的编译器，该编译器可以将大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程转换成一个单一的“超级内核”（megakernel），这是一种融合了所有必要计算和通信的 GPU 内核，能够在一次启动中完成所有操作。这种方法通过减少 LLM 推理延迟 1.2-6.7 倍，显著提高了性能。编译器易于使用，只需几十行 Python 代码即可将 LLM 编译成高性能的超级内核。\n\n文章的核心思想是，传统的 LLM 系统通常依赖于一系列 GPU 内核启动和外部通信调用，导致硬件利用率不足。新开发的编译器自动将这些操作（跨越多个层、迭代和 GPU）融合成一个超级内核。这种设计消除了启动开销，实现了跨层的细粒度软件流水线，并允许在 GPU 之间重叠计算与通信。\n尽管有这些优势，将 LLM 编译成超级内核极具挑战性。现有的高级机器学习框架（如 PyTorch、Triton 和 TVM）并不支持端到端的超级内核生成。此外，现代 LLM 系统由多种专门的内核库构建：NCCL 或 NVSHMEM 用于通信，FlashInfer 或 FlashAttention 用于高效的注意力机制，CUDA 或 Triton 用于自定义计算。这种碎片化使得将整个推理管道整合到一个统一的内核中变得困难。\n文章接着介绍了 Mirage Persistent Kernel（MPK），这是一个由 CMU、UW、Berkeley、NVIDIA 和清华大学的团队开发的编译器和运行时系统，它能够自动将多 GPU LLM 推理转换成高性能的超级内核。MPK 在开发人员只需最少手动努力的情况下，解锁了端到端 GPU 融合的优势。\n文章的优势在于，MPK 通过消除内核启动开销，并最大化地重叠计算、数据加载和跨 GPU 通信，实现了极低的 LLM 推理延迟。图 1 展示了 MPK 与现有 LLM 推理系统在单 GPU 和多 GPU 配置上的的性能比较。在单个 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU 上，MPK 将每个 token 的解码延迟从 14.5 毫秒降低到 12.5 毫秒，接近基于 1.6TB/s 内存带宽加载 16GB 权重的理论下限 10 毫秒。\n文章还讨论了 MPK 如何工作，分为两部分：第一部分介绍了 MPK 编译器，它将 LLM 的计算图转换为优化的任务图；第二部分涵盖了 MPK 运行时，它在超级内核内执行任务图，以实现高吞吐量和低延迟。\n在 MPK 任务图中，每个任务代表分配给单个 GPU 流式多处理器（SM）的计算或通信单元，每个事件代表任务之间的同步点。任务图允许 MPK 发现在计算图中会被遗漏的流水线机会。MPK 还自动为每个任务生成高性能的 CUDA 实现，使用 Mirage 内核超级优化器确保每个任务在 GPU SM 上高效运行。\n最后，MPK 包括一个在 GPU 上运行的运行时系统，它在单个 GPU 超级内核内完全执行任务图，允许在推理期间对任务执行和调度进行细粒度控制，无需任何内核启动。MPK 静态地将所有流式多处理器（SM）划分为工人和调度器两种角色，它们的数目在内核启动时固定，并与物理 SM 的数量相匹配，避免了任何动态上下文切换开销。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44321672\n将大型语言模型（LLMs）编译成 MegaKernel 是实现低延迟推理的有前景的路径。\nCUDA 编程模型可能限制了硬件资源的有效利用，尤其是在低延迟和批量小的情况下。\n将工作集成到 PyTorch 作为实验性后端的可能性令人兴奋。\nMPK 项目与 Stanford 的 MegaKernel 项目相似，但 MPK 采用编译器驱动的方法，更易于编程。\n训练优化可能不如推理优化重要，因为训练通常涉及更大的内核。\nFlashDMoE 论文实现了在单个内核中快速分布式 MoE 模型。\n通用 CPU 将继续作为协调 GPU 的小脑存在。\n直接将软件编译成硬件的想法可能不会成为主流。\n将 LLM 直接映射到硬件在未来可能是有意义的，但目前保持权重在内存中并重用共享计算块更有意义。\nAI 硬件初创公司已经在做类似的事情，但它们更通用，主要在架构上专业化，而不是权重上。\n将 LLMs 部署在本地并拔掉网线可以轻松实现空气隔离工作。\nLLM-in-a-box 的想法对于需要空气隔离的工作来说非常有用。\n将 LLMs 部署在类似比特币挖矿 USB 设备的专用设备上是一个有趣的想法。\n#\n\n\n

2018 年 5 月 9 日。文章以讽刺的口吻探讨了美国无家可归问题的严重性，并批判了那些不愿意通过改变自身行为或政策来解决这一问题的人。\n文章开头，作者表达了自己对无家可归问题的关注，并声称愿意尽一切努力解决这个问题，但前提是不改变分区法律、不影响自己独自驾车上班的能力，或者不改变任何现状。作者讽刺地描述了自己愿意偶尔给饥饿的人一个三明治，并在朋友面前炫耀，但前提是他们不要在自己的视线范围内吃东西。\n作者强调每个人都应该有床睡觉，但同时指出无家可归者对房产价值的破坏。他自称是一个创新者，通过创立公司利用技术制造智能茶壶等产品来为社会做出贡献。他认为自己是一个赢家，社区也是赢家，但解决无家可归问题的方式是避免直接面对问题，比如写信给当地报纸编辑、在社交媒体上发表歧视性帖子，以及经常报警。\n文章中，作者提到自己拥有一个从父母那里继承的单家庭迷你豪宅，或者是一个豪华的公寓，他不愿意因为建造更多的房屋而破坏自己的生活方式。他讽刺地描述了自己的家是如何被杂物填满或者出租给来自其他城市的年轻人，同时强调自己是一个努力工作、慷慨的人，他的一切成就都是自己努力得来的。\n作者还提到了美国财富集中的问题，但他更关心的是在 Whole Foods 购物时不得不对乞讨者说不。他对声称是退伍军人的无家可归者表示怀疑，并质疑他们的真实性。\n最后，作者讽刺地表示，如果给无家可归者提供住房，他们可能会开始整理生活、找到工作并组织起来，这可能会导致医疗保险普及、公共交通建设等变化，最终导致汽车消失、空气变干净，而这是作者不愿意看到的。因此，他宁愿保持无家可归危机，也不愿意建造更多的房屋。\n文章最后呼吁读者支持作者和保持网站无广告，通过成为赞助人来支持。同时，提供了订阅 McSweeney’s Internet Tendency 的 Substack 和新闻通讯的链接，以及其他相关文章的推荐阅读。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44325617\n有些人认为，无家可归者的问题不仅仅是房屋成本问题，更多是心理健康、药物滥用和缺乏支持系统的问题。\n有些人指出，许多无家可归者是因为临时的经济困难、家庭问题或法律问题而流落街头。\n有人认为，无家可归者中许多人并非因为精神健康或药物问题而无家可归，而是这些问题导致他们无家可归。\n有人提出，即使住房免费也无法解决无家可归问题，因为存在免费避难所但无家可归现象依然存在。\n有人通过极端情况的假设，认为如果取消所有分区限制，可以建造胶囊旅馆，降低住房成本。\n有人担心，这样的旅馆最终会充满精神健康问题、药物依赖和暴力的人，导致大多数人宁愿住在帐篷里。\n有人提出，大学宿舍似乎能够解决类似的问题，也许成年人也可以。\n有人指出，大学宿舍与无家可归者的情况不同，因为宿舍里没有精神健康问题和药物成瘾者。\n有人认为，拥有屋顶应该是一项权利而非特权，房地产被视为投资导致了这一问题。\n有人强调，许多无家可归者因为避难所中的问题（如暴力、药物滥用、盗窃等）而宁愿选择街头。\n有人提出，将住房视为权利而非特权是一回事，但将其纳入法律并确保不破坏其他领域是另一回事。\n有人指出，无家可归者的精神健康问题往往是因为无家可归而加剧的。\n有人根据研究指出，无家可归的主要原因是租金上涨，而非心理健康问题。\n有人提到，许多无家可归者被称为“隐形”无家可归者，因为他们看起来正常，甚至可能有工作。\n#\n\n\n  https://blog.persistent.info/2025/03/infinite-mac-os-x.html\n这篇文章主要介绍了作者在模拟早期 Mac OS X 系统方面的工作和进展。\n\n\nInfinite Mac 现在可以运行早期的 Mac OS X 系统，其中 10.1 和 10.3 版本支持最好。虽然运行速度并不快，但作者表示，这与当时实际硬件上的表现相差无几。Infinite HD 也经过重建，增加了一些那个时代的知名独立软件。\n作者之前一直在跟踪 DingusPPC 的进展，并尝试将其用于在 Infinite Mac 上运行 Mac OS X。但在去年夏天，他遇到了瓶颈，尝试运行时要么出现内核崩溃，要么出现图形损坏。他尝试通过确定性执行模式来减少问题，但下一步的方向并不明确。因此，他决定暂时放下这个模拟器，探索其他途径来运行 Mac OS X。\nPearPC 成为了一个明显的选择，因为它在 21 世纪初就是为了在 x86 Windows 和 Linux 机器上模拟 Mac OS X 而创建的。尽管在英特尔转型后兴趣减弱，但 PearPC 在一段时间内成功地完成了这一任务。作者最初认为 PearPC 是一个“死亡”的代码库，但后来决定尝试使用它，以获得让事情工作的满足感。他发现 kanjitalk755（Basilisk II 和 SheepShaver 的实际维护者）最近在 PearPC 上设置了一个实验分支，可以在现代 macOS 上构建和运行。作者能够复制他们的工作，然后开始了他的第六次模拟器移植到 WebAssembly/Emscripten 和 Infinite Mac 运行时的工作。\nPearPC 不再积极开发，这让事情变得更容易，因为作者不需要担心合并上游的更改，也不需要纠结如何结构化他的修改以便于贡献回去。PearPC 已经是一个多平台代码库，因此添加另一个目标相对容易。此外，它没有广泛使用线程或其他难以移植的概念。在几天内，作者成功让 PearPC 构建、输出视频、加载磁盘映像，并连接鼠标和键盘输入。能够在浏览器中更可靠地运行 Mac OS X 10.2，这让他感到非常满意。\n尽管 PearPC 运行 10.2 更可靠，但感觉比 DingusPCC 慢。作者去年花了一些时间对后者进行了优化，部分灵感来自 SheepShaver 分支中的 TinyPPC 模拟器。他移植了 DingusPPC 的基准测试框架，然后开始在 PearPC 中复制性能工作（两个模拟器都是由查找表驱动的纯解释器，因此过程相对简单）。他成功将 10.2 的启动时间缩短了大约 15 秒，虽然这有助于节省生命，但考虑到完全启动需要近 2 分钟，这仍然不够。最后，他不得不在用户界面上添加一个免责声明，说明 Mac OS X 启动可能较慢。他还回忆起 Mac OS X 早期的“它现在快了吗？”讨论——它确实慢，但没那么慢。\n性能仍然不如 DingusPPC 好，最大的瓶颈是 MMU 中没有任何缓存，因此所有加载和存储都很贵，因为它们涉及复杂的地址计算。DingusPPC 有一个更成熟的分层缓存，看起来非常有效。更一般地说，尽管 PearPC 在运行 10.2-10.4 时可能比 DingusPPC 更稳定，但它的代码库原则性较差（作者遇到了许多神秘的提交），并且在许多方面“作弊”（它有自定义固件和视频驱动程序，并且只实现了 Mac OS X 所需的 PowerPC 指令子集）。作者仍然希望 DingusPPC 能成为长期快速、稳定和正确的选择。\n作者在 PearPC 的解释器中逐个操作码族实现了“统一解码表”方法。当他处理浮点操作时，本以为这将是另一个机械变化。然而，他惊讶地发现行为出现了退化——Dock 出现了一些渲染故障，Finder 窗口根本无法打开。经过一些调试，他注意到操作码组 59 和 63 的调度不仅仅是对相关指令位进行基本查找。它首先检查机器状态寄存器（MSR）的 FP 位，如果未设置，则会引发“浮点不可用”异常。\n作者最初认为这是模拟器过于挑剔——所有用于 Mac 的 PowerPC 芯片都有 FPU，所以这应该永远不会发生。然而，设置断点显示异常在 Mac OS X 启动期间频繁发生。当时的 xnu 内核源代码是可用的，尽管作者不熟悉细节，但有地方清除了 FP 位并注册了处理结果异常的处理程序。他假设这是一种优化，以避免在上下文切换期间保存/恢复 FPU 寄存器（如果它们没有被使用）。结果是，一旦他在优化的调度代码中实现了等效的 FP 检查，渲染问题就消失了。\n这让他想起了在 DingusPPC 下运行 Mac OS X 时遇到的渲染故障。即使从 10.2 安装 CD 启动（它不会内核崩溃），他最终也会遇到缺少文本和其他问题：检查 DingusPPC 源代码显示它从未检查 FP 位，并始终允许浮点指令通过。他做了一个快速的黑客攻击来检查它，并在需要时引发异常，故障就消失了！\n适当的实现更加复杂，他最终对其进行了一些修订以避免性能损失（另一位贡献者又进行了一次修订）。但最终，DingusPPC 变得更加稳定，这是一个不错的副作用。更好的是，它可以可靠地运行 10.1，而 PearPC 不能。他最终使用两个模拟器的组合来运行更广泛的早期 Mac OS X（不幸的是，10.0 仍然不稳定，公共测试版内核立即崩溃，但他对未来抱有希望）。\n重建 Infinite HD：Infinite Mac 的吸引力之一是模拟的机器还挂载了一个“无限硬盘”，里面有很多适合那个时代的软件可以尝试。随着 Mac OS X 的运行，是时候构建一个超越 80 年代和 90 年代经典 Mac 应用程序的替代版本了。他有他的最爱，但也征求了建议，并得到了很多想法。\n对于实际构建磁盘映像，他扩展了最初启动网站时的自动化方法。磁盘映像在 Mac OS X 的早期比今天更受欢迎，所以他添加了一种将.dmgs 作为附加文件夹导入到生成的映像中的方法。然而，他很快发现，尽管具有相同的扩展名，但有许多变体，现代 macOS 附带的 hdiutil 并不总是能够挂载 20 多年前生成的映像。最后，他最终采用了一种鲁布·戈德堡方法，首先通过 dmg2img 提取原始分区，然后重新创建一个可以挂载和复制的“现代”磁盘映像。\n至于获取实际软件，像 Macintosh Garden 这样的常规网站确实有一些来自那个时代的内容，但这不是他们的优先事项。早期到中期 2000 年代的 Mac OS X 软件似乎是一个小小的盲点——它太新了，不能算是真正的“复古”，但太老了，以至于不能从原始供应商那里获得（尽管有例外）。他最终使用了…\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44323719\nPearPC 项目因原维护者意外去世而失去了大部分动力\n有观点认为一些技术高超的开发者可能被外星人带走了\n有人提到自杀的可能性\nCherryOS

Ryan，她最初对拥堵收费政策感到愤怒，因为这意味着她每天需要支付 9 美元的过路费。然而，自从政策实施后，她的出行时间从超过一个小时缩短到了 15 分钟，她的态度也随之发生了变化。现在，更多的纽约人支持这一收费政策，而不是反对。\n文章指出，拥堵收费政策在曼哈顿取得了可预测的成功，这让人不禁要问，为什么这项政策花了这么长时间才开始实施。文章通过 Maura Ryan 的例子和其他纽约市民的反馈，展示了拥堵收费政策如何有效地减少了交通拥堵，提高了出行效率。\n文章还提到了其他与美国相关的新闻和话题，包括民主党在权力运用上的表现、明尼苏达州的袭击事件、特朗普总统在摇摆州的支持率，以及纽约市长竞选中民主党内部的功能障碍等。这些内容虽然在文章中有所提及，但不是文章的主要内容，因此没有详细展开。\n总的来说，这篇文章通过具体的例子和数据，展示了拥堵收费政策在纽约市的成功实施，并对政策实施的延迟提出了质疑。\n#\n\n\n

开始投资于内部专业技能的建设，以减少对外部承包商的依赖。\n美国公共部门普遍存在将工作外包给私营部门的问题，这导致成本增加和效率低下。\n私有化实际上是为了将政府资金转移到私人口袋中，而不是为了提高效率。\n私有化是现代版的庇护政治，可以持续地将政府资金转移到特定受益者手中。\n给失业工人提供资金或免费公共服务是不被接受的，因此需要通过虚假工作来洗钱。\n选民是否真的推动了外包，还是咨询公司和工会在推动这一过程。\n美国政府机构依赖于私营公司来执行政府任务，这导致了成本增加和缺乏长期内部专业知识。\n许多声称私有化能提高效率的公司实际上主要依赖政府合同，导致同样的问题只是外包了。\n#\n\n\n  https://makefiletutorial.com/\n这个网页是一个关于 Makefiles 的教程，旨在帮助用户理解和掌握 Makefiles 的使用方法。以下是网页内容的中文摘要：\nMakefiles 的用途：\nMakefiles 主要用于大型程序中决定哪些部分需要重新编译。大多数情况下，涉及 C 或 C++ 文件的编译。其他语言通常有自己的工具来实现类似 Make 的功能。Make 也可以用于编译之外的场景，比如当需要根据文件变化来执行一系列指令时。本教程将重点放在 C/C++ 编译的使用案例上。\nMakefile 的替代品：\n流行的 C/C++ 替代构建系统有 SCons、CMake、Bazel 和 Ninja。一些代码编辑器，如 Microsoft Visual Studio，有自己的内置构建工具。对于 Java，有 Ant、Maven 和 Gradle。其他语言如 Go、Rust 和 TypeScript 也有自己的构建工具。解释型语言如 Python、Ruby 和原生 Javascript 不需要类似 Makefiles 的工具，因为当这些语言的文件变化时，不需要重新编译，程序运行时会使用文件的最新版本。\nMake 的版本和类型：\nMake 有多种实现版本，但本指南主要适用于 GNU Make，这是 Linux 和 MacOS 上的标准实现。所有示例适用于 Make 版本 3 和 4，这两个版本除了一些深奥的差异外几乎相同。\n运行示例：\n要运行这些示例，你需要一个终端和安装了\"make\"。对于每个示例，将内容放入名为 Makefile 的文件中，并在该目录下运行 make 命令。以一个最简单的 Makefile 开始：\nhello:\necho \"Hello, World\"\n\n\n运行上述示例的输出如下：\n$ make\necho \"Hello, World\"\nHello, World\n\n\n如果对 Makefiles 的结构还不太了解，有一个视频可以介绍这些步骤以及 Makefiles 的基本结构。\nMakefile 语法：\nMakefile 由一系列规则组成。一个规则通常看起来像这样：\ntargets: prerequisites\ncommand\ncommand\ncommand\n\n\n目标是文件名，由空格分隔。通常每个规则只有一个目标。\n命令是一系列步骤，通常用于创建目标。这些步骤需要以制表符开始，而不是空格。\n前提条件也是文件名，由空格分隔。这些文件在运行目标的命令之前需要存在。这些也被称为依赖项。\nMake 的本质：\n以一个 hello world 示例开始：\nhello:\necho \"Hello, World\"\necho \"This line will print if the file hello does not exist.\"\n\n\n这里有很多内容需要理解。让我们分解一下：\n我们有一个名为 hello 的目标\n这个目标有两个命令\n这个目标没有前提条件\n然后我们运行 make hello。只要 hello 文件不存在，命令就会运行。如果 hello 文件存在，命令就不会运行。\n重要的是要意识到，这里将 hello 既作为目标也作为文件来讨论。这是因为两者直接联系在一起。通常，当运行目标（即运行目标的命令）时，命令会创建一个与目标同名的文件。在这个例子中，hello 目标没有创建 hello 文件。\n更多快速示例：\n以下 Makefile 最终运行所有三个目标。当你在终端运行 make 时，它将分步骤构建一个名为 blah 的程序：\nMake 选择目标 blah，因为第一个目标是默认目标\nblah 需要 blah.o，所以 make 搜索 blah.o 目标\nblah.o 需要 blah.c，所以 make 搜索 blah.c 目标\nblah.c 没有依赖项，所以执行 echo 命令…\n这个网页通过提供详细的解释和示例，帮助用户理解 Makefiles 的基本概念和语法，以及如何使用 Makefiles 来管理大型项目的编译过程。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44325611\n1985 年，有人在波士顿大学图形实验室使用 Makefiles 生成 3D 渲染器，非常优雅，仅 10 行代码。\n有人提到了 Brian Gardner，一个 3D 渲染领域的专家，曾参与《铁巨人》和《卡罗兰》的 3D 渲染工作。\n有人分享了一些不太为人所知的 make 命令行选项，如 --output-sync、--load-average 和 --shuffle。\n有人建议 make 的作者可以整理一个选项列表，方便用户查阅。\n有人认为，既然大家都能找到手册，就没有必要再整理一个选项列表。\n有人指出，make 的手册中已经列出了所有选项，可以通过 make --help 查看常用选项。\n有人提到 -B 选项用于无条件构建所有目标。\n有人质疑在多用户系统上，操作系统调度器是否可以处理并行任务。\n有人反映 make -j 会导致系统不稳定，认为这是一个 bug。\n有人认为如果 make -j 导致系统饱和，说明系统没有严重的瓶颈。\n有人建议 --jobs 的默认值应该是一个有限的数字，而不是无限大。\n有人提到，使用 --jobs 时，最大的瓶颈是随机 IO，而不是 CPU 或内存。\n有人认为，如果 make -j 导致系统不稳定，应该归类为“使用不当”。\n有人强调，专业使用工具的人应该阅读该工具的手册，尤其是对于基础工具。\n#\n\n\n  https://texashighways.com/travel-news/the-history-of-juneteenth-in-photos/\n这篇文章是关于美国德克萨斯州的六月节（Juneteenth）的历史和庆祝活动的视觉记录。以下是文章的中文摘要：\n关于六月节：\n1865 年 6 月，联邦军队少将戈登·格兰杰抵达加尔维斯顿，宣布德克萨斯州政府非法，并发布了包括解放奴隶在内的一系列命令。其中，第 3 号将军令涉及德克萨斯州的奴隶制。该命令宣布所有奴隶获得自由，并指出前主人和奴隶之间的权利和财产权利现在平等，他们之间的关系转变为雇主和雇员。尽管这一命令在《解放宣言》发布两年半后才传达到德克萨斯的非洲裔美国人，但许多听到消息的前奴隶离开了种植园前往北方。留在加尔维斯顿的人则在第二年的 6 月 19 日举行了庆祝活动，这一天后来被称为解放日，逐渐演变成“六月节”。庆祝活动逐渐扩展到邻近的州。\n1979 年，休斯顿的民主党众议员阿尔·爱德华兹提出了一项法案，要求将六月节定为州假日。该法案在 1979 年通过，并由共和党州长威廉·克莱门茨签署成为法律。1980 年举行了第一次州赞助的六月节庆祝活动。2021 年 6 月 17 日，美国总统乔·拜登签署法案，将六月节定为联邦假日。\n六月节庆祝活动：\n文章展示了从 1900 年到 2018 年不同年份的六月节庆祝活动的照片。这些照片记录了在奥斯汀、休斯顿和科珀斯克里斯蒂等地举行的庆祝活动，包括乐队表演、日记记录、艺术俱乐部游行花车、公主和王子的庆祝、西部表演、网球比赛、小六月节小姐比赛等。这些照片展示了六月节庆祝活动的多样性和社区的参与。\n前奴隶的故事：\n文章还介绍了几位前奴隶的故事，包括鲍勃·莱蒙斯（Bob Lemmons）和安娜·摩尔·施维恩（Anna Moore Schwien）。鲍勃·莱蒙斯大约在 1847 年出生，1854 年被带到德克萨斯，解放后成为德克萨斯牧场主邓肯·莱蒙斯的学徒，并最终购买了自己的牧场。安娜·摩尔·施维恩 1856 年出生在新布朗费尔斯附近的一个羊场，她曾短暂地嫁给一个德国移民，后来因嫁给黑人女性而被赶出城镇，但她并不怀恨在心，她说过：“你不能带着恨意去天堂。”安娜于 1946 年去世。\n文章通过这些故事和照片，展现了六月节的历史意义和庆祝活动的发展，以及前奴隶们的生活和他们对自由的珍视。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44320851\n有人觉得“Juneteenth”这个名称不如“Emancipation Day”直观，因为很多人不知道“Juneteenth”的含义。\n有人支持“Juneteenth”这个名称，认为它体现了非裔美国文化，迫使人们去了解和记住黑人的历史。\n有人认为“Juneteenth”听起来像是一个现代词汇，而不是一个历史悠久的术语，可能不会激发人们的好奇心。\n有人指出“Emancipation Day”在美国可能会引起混淆，因为不同州有不同的“Emancipation Day”纪念不同的事件。\n有人提到，很多国家的节假日名称都很晦涩，需要查资料才能了解其含义。\n有人强调，节日的名称是为了纪念那些祖先获得自由的人，而不是为了让外人容易理解。\n#\n\n\n  https://peoplevsbig.tech/break-up-big-tech-civil-society-declaration/\n这篇文章是一份来自欧洲及全球民间组织和人民的宣言，呼吁欧盟委员会立即采取行动，打破大型科技公司（Big Tech）对数字世界的垄断。这些科技公司不仅控制了市场，还对欧洲民主构成了威胁。文章强调，欧洲需要一个繁荣多样的数字经济，服务于欧洲公民的需求，而不是亿万富翁科技 CEO 的利益。\n文章指出，欧盟委员会有一个千载难逢的机会来拆除谷歌的广告垄断，这一垄断破坏了新闻媒体，剥削了消费者，并在美国的一项具有里程碑意义的判决中被裁定为非法。大型科技公司的垄断力量对民主构成威胁，它们集中控制了我们的核心数字基础设施，包括搜索引擎、社交媒体、应用商店和云服务。这些公司的不受限制的权力使它们能够滥用人权、剥削企业和压垮竞争对手。\n西班牙首相佩德罗·桑切斯警告说，科技亿万富翁想要“推翻民主”。当少数亿万富翁和科技巨头控制互联网时，他们利用自己的权力和巨额利润来影响政治话语和干预民主法律。今年，科技 CEO 和特朗普政府密切合作，试图阻挠欧盟的标志性数字法律，这些法律要求大型科技公司承担责任。\n文章呼吁，为了解决大型科技公司的危害，必须首先面对它们的力量。欧盟竞争事务主管特蕾莎·里贝拉认识到，拆分可以防止大型科技公司获得过多的市场力量。这些公司将数十亿欧元的罚款视为做生意的成本，而行为补救措施无效且经常被公司忽视。迫使这些巨头出售部分业务将减少利益冲突，平衡数字竞争环境，并使公司更容易对其日益增长的社会危害负责。\n文章特别提到，打破谷歌的广告垄断是欧盟的一个明显目标，得到了十八位前欧洲总统和总理的支持。谷歌的垄断不公平地从出版商那里吸取收入，扼杀新闻业和新闻媒体，同时通过“广告技术税”迫使消费者向行业中间人支付更多费用。在对谷歌广告技术的最终裁决中，委员会必须重申，只有谷歌强制剥离部分服务，才能解决竞争问题。\n文章最后强调，打破科技垄断是迈向一个更自由、更公平的互联网的一步。欧洲可以并且必须抵抗大型科技公司和特朗普政府的威胁，坚定地维护欧盟法律对抗大型科技公司。文章呼吁拆分谷歌，拆分大型科技公司，并列出了一系列签署该宣言的组织和机构。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44325596\n要求欧盟强制拆分美国公司是对抗疯狂的行为，应该通过禁止美国服务来促进本土替代品的发展\n如果公司在欧盟开展业务，它们必须遵守欧盟法规，要求拆分是合理的\n技术本身并非固有垄断性，而是集中式运作的公司导致垄断，解决方案是采用去中心化的技术\n去中心化系统在达到大规模吸引力后最终会变成中心化，因为普通用户倾向于选择简化他们生活的服务\n去中心化协议构建的系统可以避免中心化，用户可以自由选择服务，避免供应商锁定和垄断\n服务问题如账户被盗、交易逆转、欺诈追索等，在去中心化系统中并非不可能解决，只是公司没有动机去发明或使用这些解决方案\n即使去中心化协议在规模上趋于中心化，用户仍然可以选择不同的服务提供商\n通过要求互操作性和遵守标准，可能找到一种中间地带来减少大型科技公司的影响力\n标准变化缓慢，不利于快速演变的用例，有限、通用且允许上下游创新的标准更成功\nHTTPS 证明了其成功，适用于大多数用例，更复杂、高效的标准可能无法如此通用\n应该像 CERN 那样，由学术界产生简单的标准，然后由行业在社区/监管机构的推动下发展，最后发布标准",

    "description": "🦄「AI 时代，会不会出现一人独角兽公司？」\n\n欢迎来到《知行小酒馆》，这是一档由有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活。我是雨白。这期节目与其说是对谈，不如说是我和嘉宾就着一个问题，开始的一场思维实验。\n\n这场思维实验的起点其实很简单，来自我和之前的嘉宾，志伟老师的一次聊天。他说前一天参加了高中校友会，主题是「AI与未来」。我一听就乐了：这校友会太高端了，都开始聊 AI 了。但接下来他说的一个话题让我瞬间认真了——他说，那天有一场圆桌论坛在讨论：AI 时代，会不会出现一人独角兽公司？他觉得非常有启发。而这个问题，是汪天凡抛出来的。\n\n一个好问题的力量在于，它不要求你马上给出答案，而是能带你走进很多未曾探索的方向。我听完当下就想：这个问题得找汪天凡好好聊聊。第二天，就有了这一期节目。\n\n汪天凡是谁呢？他是 BAI 资本（贝塔斯曼亚洲投资基金）的合伙人，长期在一线看 AI 项目，也自己下场搭各种 AI 工具和工作流。他的表达非常精准，说话密度高得像是在写 prompt，我们的这次对谈几乎没有任何废话，信息量很大。\n\n从「一人独角兽」的设想出发，我们一起打开了好几个值得慢慢咀嚼的问题：\n\n比如，如果未来真的会有一人独角兽公司，什么样的人可以做到，我能行吗？如果未来出现了大量一人公司，那管理学还存在吗？未来的管理学、经济学、组织行为学是不是都要翻天覆地？在过去，技术变革消灭了一些工作，又带来了一些新工作，这次 AI 技术也会如此吗？还是说有大量的工作岗位会永久性的消失？面对 AI，我们这些普通人究竟可以从哪开始行动呢？\n\n这不是一场讲座，我们不轻易下任何论断，只是邀请你，一起进行一场思维上的探险。\n\n如果你也刚好在好奇这些问题，也许这期节目，会带来一些意料之外的线索。希望你会喜欢。\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n汪天凡：BAI 资本合伙人，主要 AI 相关投资：Tensor Art，Sparkii，Meshy AI，Thetawave，Viture，Looki AI。\n\n🪁 时间轴\n\n03:03 AI 时代，一人独角兽是否会发生？最有可能在哪些领域发生？\n\n08:09 三个灵魂拷问：你是否相信大模型？是否相信年轻人？是否相信开源？\n\n15:27 在 AI 时代，做个会提要求的人类，从搭建自己的 prompt 弹药库开始\n\n21:15 先别说怎样让下一代拥抱 AI 时代了，我自己就很无助了好吧 🤯\n\n26:22  如果技术不是这个行业的天花板，那什么是？创业者理解用户需求的能力\n\n29:09 过去两三年引发大众参与热潮的 AI 产品，它们的共同点是什么？\n\n36:06 AI 投资的挑战：这个领域的潜力股，往往具有非共识、非线性，非连续的特征\n\n47:10 选择那些符合你天赋或热爱的工作，因为 AI 会打败所有平庸的努力\n\n57:01  很多人说 AI 是生产力革命，区块链是生产关系革命，我的观点恰恰相反\n\n64:07 万物皆可定价，但不是所有人都想把自己的创造资本化：在未来，一级市场人的工作方式会被改变吗？\n\n76:26 一样很想分享给你的好东西\n\n✏️ 猜你想看\n\n02:58 一人独角兽（One-Person Unicorn）：指由一个人运用 AI 技术独立创建并管理，估值可达到 10 亿美元的企业或项目。\n\n03:30 SaaS 软件：通过网络直接使用的软件服务，不需要下载，比如飞书。\n\n04:48 SKU：商品的最小库存单位，例如同一款衣服的不同尺码算不同的SKU。\n\n05:54 PE：市盈率，用来评估公司估值高低，可以简单理解为数值越高表示市场更看好公司未来的盈利能力。\n\n07:03 Wrap，wrapper：在 AI 领域指对已有AI模型进行简单包装，自身并不生产模型，而是利用别人的模型提供服务。\n\n11:05 开源：将代码、软件或数据公开，所有人都能免费使用、修改和共享。\n\n16:27 prompt 库（Prompt Database）：用户积累和整理的，用于指示 AI 执行特定任务的语句模板库。\n\n28:05 high profile 的团队：知名度高、经验丰富的团队，通常由大厂或明星公司前高管组成。\n\n28:39 Perplexity：海外知名的AI搜索与知识问答工具，整合并展示互联网上的最新信息。\n\n28:46 Capwords：一款获苹果年度设计奖的语言学习APP，用 AI 帮助用户轻松学外语。\n\n37:48 ProSumer：介于专业人士（producer）和普通消费者（consumer）之间，具备一定专业知识、追求专业品质的消费人群。\n\n43:05 以太坊（Ethereum）：一种著名的区块链平台和加密货币，以智能合约技术为核心，常用于去中心化应用。\n\n44:07 Cursor：一款使用 AI 辅助程序员快速编程的开源代码编辑器。\n\n🔎 汪天凡老师提供的 prompt\n\n#录音简单总结\n\n以下是我和一个xxx的对话，因为记得比较碎片，请帮我在完全不改变原意和细节的前提下，将以下内容补充整理成有结构有细节的notes，这个notes不能丢失和必须包含以下所有文字，100%保留以下所有文字，只能进行补充和文字顺序调整，不能删掉以下任何文字，尤其是细节不能动，谢谢\n\n#录音详细总结\n\n请把讲话人录音总结成多条核心观点，格式：\n\n1.先一句话写出那个核心观点\n\n2.然后在下面按照原文的内容总结这个核心观点的一些解释和拓展\n\n3.纠正语音转化错误，确保信息的准确性。专业词汇有：具身智能 （这里可以自己添加）\n\n4. 同一个讲话人的观点聚类，就是不要把不同讲话人的观点汇总到一块\n\n5. 请忽略无意义的问候比如你好，听得见吗这些话\n\n6. 如果涉及重要的可投资项目，人物，请务必100%帮我记录下来\n\n7. 如果涉及到业务数据，用户数据，数字，关键核心指标的内容，请务必100%帮我记录下来\n\n8. 如果涉及到融资，融资历史，投资人，投资机构，估值，融资投资金额，请务必100%帮我记录下来\n\n9. 大标题请包含你推测的这个项目的名称或者这个人的名称，以便我未来搜索\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🩻 基金 CT\n\n最近，有知有行 App 更新了一个功能，叫做基金 CT。顾名思义，就是给你投资的基金，照个 CT。\n\n相比那些普通投资者一眼就能看到的业绩、收益率、排行榜，在我们投资基金时，其实还有一些数据，它们往往很难被普通投资者发现，但却对我们了解投资的真实收益与成本，至关重要。\n\n而有知有行最新开发的这个工具，就希望展示出这些「背后的东西」。只需要在 基金 CT 中输入基金代码、名称或者基金经理的名字，你就可以一目了然地看到这支基金的投资者实际收益、真实风格、长期表现、完整的投资成本，以及基金经理的跟投情况等诸多数据。\n\n我们希望，这个工具，能够帮助投资者们更放心、更有把握地做出投资决策。\n\n更新 有知有行 APP 到最新版本，在「有行」页面就可以找到基金 CT 了，输入代码、名称或者基金经理，给你关注或持有的基金照一下 CT 吧～\n\n\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 汪天凡｜主持 雨白｜制作 星星 雨烨｜后期 甜食｜单集封面 Recraft\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "description": "在四大名著中，《三国演义》历经千年被国内外的市民流行文化不断演绎、改编，从话本评书到地方戏剧，从民间信仰到浮世绘，从影视到游戏，深入人心，以至于人们常常把《三国演义》当作三国历史本身。特别是三绝形象令人印象深刻：“智绝”诸葛亮、“义绝”关羽、“奸绝”曹操。\n\n这其中，曹操作为最大反派，甚至就成为“奸臣”本身的代名词，以至于影响了严肃历史书写。但是在20世纪中国史学研究中，有关曹操的研究却经历了巨大的变化：陈寅恪将士族/寒族的社会文化身份框架引入历史分析，特殊时期的扬法贬儒大大扭转了曹操积累千年的历史形象，新时代结构化历史研究则削弱了曹操个人的作用，强调其身上承载的难以左右的历史进程力量。\n\n直到今天，曹操仍然是历史研究和写作的热门。著名媒体人连清川和知名历史作家刘三解在今年初先后出版了《曹操的自白书》和《汉末之变》两本书。两位老师选择了十分不同的写作方式，呈现了正反两个曹操形象。今天我们就请两位老师共同聊一下历史中的双面曹操。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n主播：何必（北京大学历史学博士）\n\n嘉宾：连清川（作家、媒体人，《曹操的自白书》作者）\n\n嘉宾：刘三解（历史作家，《汉末之变》作者）\n\n【收听指南】\n\n01:53 同一段历史，不同的写法\n\n04:48 《让县自明本志令》背后的曹操\n\n07:01 从《秦砖》《汉瓦》到“魏阙”三部曲\n\n12:01 非虚构的写法：将历史人物和事件以流畅的故事形式呈现给读者，注重信息收集和客观性，而不做结论\n\n21:55 学院派的新写法：基于问题意识，通过批判性史料分析，以人物串起有效信息，试图重新解读历史事件\n\n31:53 《曹操集》是容易被忽略的研究资料\n\n39:42 《述志令》中，曹操的自白何以真诚？\n\n44:18 比起情绪与褒贬，更关心史料的事实\n\n49:25 曹操对汉帝的忠诚，曹操与荀彧的合作\n\n56:40 曹魏政权为了自身合法性曾涂抹过史料\n\n01:00:43 对历史人物的陟罚臧否是否还有意义？\n\n01:09:41 二元对立没有意义，但难免会有褒贬\n\n01:16:39 如何看待事功的起点：平定黄巾军和反董卓\n\n01:24:28 家世差距：曹操和袁绍有少年情谊吗？\n\n01:31:37 不是圣人或魔鬼，他首先是个普通人\n\n01:37:49 东汉末年，秦汉帝国的历史出口在哪？\n\n01:40:10 历史中的偶然性因素与必然性因素\n\n01:52:39 从东汉末年到隋唐的政治制度变革\n\n【工具箱】\n\n《曹操的自白书》是一部历史非虚构作品，书写的主题为“历史中的曹操”。作者连清川试图通过对相关历史资料的深入研究和对相关文献的解读，在历史学基础上，运用文学的语言和想象力，还原作为历史人物的曹操更加复杂、生动，不为人知的一面。连清川不仅关注曹操作为一代传奇人物的辉煌胜利，更着重描绘了曹操在追求理想、实现抱负过程中遭遇的挫折与失败。在这本书中，曹操不再是单一的“恶人”或“英雄”形象，而是一个有血有肉、有情感有矛盾的立体人物。\n\n《汉末之变 : 曹操发迹与董卓之死》一书的主角是初平三年（192年）之前的曹操和董卓，主题是“篡权者的真面目”。作者刘三解讲的是曹操和董卓这两个将天子、朝廷玩弄于股掌间的汉末权臣，面对汉末乱世的不同选择，以及大转折时代背景下，何进、王允、袁绍、袁术等豪杰之士的复杂面相。汉末乱世，不仅有毫无底线、两面三刀的投机者左右逢源，更有自诩忠于汉室、顺应天命的士大夫在扰乱朝纲。他们的忠奸贤愚，全都隐藏在史书的字缝里。\n\n【线下活动信息】\n\n【文明】土耳其学术考察招募启动~\n\n8月9日-8月16日，与施展、许小亮两位老师一起探寻土耳其。在一系列“文明的拼贴”现场，亲眼见证信仰如何整合政治权威，传统与现代生活如何并置共存，神圣的仪式与日常的节奏如何交织共生。添加【eidos6719】即可了解详细信息。\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台找到我们。欢迎关注、评论、转发，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：media@eidos.wiki",

    "url": "http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/06/weekly-issue-353.html",
    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n6月17日晚，重庆举行超大规模无人机表演，共有11787架无人机，上图是其中一个场景\"天上的重庆\"。（via）\n苹果的\"液态玻璃\"是为了 AR\n上周，苹果公司发布了新的设计风格\"液态玻璃\"（liquid glass）。\n\n这种风格使用液体玻璃，作为控件（上图）。早先的扁平化风格，被一股脑抛弃。\n下图左面是原来扁平化风格的 iPhone，右面是这次测试版的液态玻璃。\n\n我知道的绝大部分人，对这种新风格都是差评，觉得不好看。大家想不通，为什么苹果要在屏幕上，添加一个额外的半透明玻璃层。\n甚至有人说，如果乔布斯看到 iPhone 变成这样，会解雇所有人（下图）。\n\n那么，到底为什么呢，苹果好端端的，突然要大改界面？\n官方完全回避这个问题，我倒是看到一篇解读，提出了一个很有见解的猜测。\n他说，苹果这样做，压根不是为了审美，而是为了下一代的空间计算，也就是 AR。\n现在的计算设备，都是二维的平面交互，用户面对一个扁平的屏幕，所以适合二维的扁平化风格。\n但是，对于 AR 设备，用户进入的是一个 3D 空间，接触的东西都是立体的，所以需要一个立体的界面。\nAR 设备没有屏幕，只有空间。屏幕不重要，空间才重要。\n液态玻璃就是一个空间设计，目的是让界面有一个实体，让你感觉每个按钮都是一个有体积的实物。并且，它半透明，不会遮住后面，从而产生空间层次感。\n从这个角度，苹果的界面设计副总裁 Alan Dye 对液态玻璃的介绍，就很容易解读。\n每个元素都经过精心设计，赋予了它们物理感：它们具有维度，能够动态响应光线，并投射阴影。\n苹果的 AR 设备，目前只有 Vision Pro 头盔。\n\n液态玻璃界面，应该最初是为了这个头盔设计的。在 AR 空间中，操作界面就是一块悬浮的玻璃，这非常合理。\n\n苹果为了统一设计语言，索性让 iPhone 和 Mac 也用了它。开发者只需要设计一次，就能适配所有苹果设备。\n这样做，有利于推广 AR。试想一下，用户在手机和电脑上，已经熟悉了液态玻璃风格，当他最终戴上 AR 设备时，就不会对这种界面感到陌生，仿佛 AR 设备只是 iPhone 的自然延伸。\n如果苹果确实是这样的考虑，那么我们可以确定，苹果下一步会大力推广空间计算。\nVision Pro 虽然卖得不好，但是苹果不仅不会放弃它，反而会加大投入，很可能还会推出轻量级的 AR 眼镜。\n\nAR 也许是计算机行业的下一个热点，苹果已经在布局。\n并且，液态玻璃界面要求实时模糊、动态透明、情境照明。这些效果需要强大的 GPU 实时渲染，这正是苹果芯片的强项，对手的硬件可能会出现卡顿，从而进一步加大苹果的优势。\n科技动态\n（1）Meta 公司推出 AI 广告，用户上传产品照片，系统就会自动生成广告视频，并配好音乐和文案。\n\n未来，广告的制作成本越来越低，注定会无所不在，并且还会针对每个人，生成个性化广告。\n（2）加拿大有一只小乌龟，断了一只脚。一家博物馆用乐高积木，为它制作了助行器。\n\n\n这件事很有意义，因为乌龟的寿命很长，可以达到50年～80年。助行器能帮助它几十年。\n\n（3）美国国防部研究局 DARPA，创造了无线传输能量的世界纪录。\n\n他们使用激光，在8.6公里外传输能量，持续了30秒，每秒功率超过800瓦。这是迄今无线传输能量的最远距离。\n上图是激光接收器，激光进入中心的孔以后，会被反射到内部的数十个光伏板，这些光伏板将能量转换回电能。\n（4）除了人形机器人，还有虫形机器人。\n\n一家美国公司制作了蜈蚣机器人，它可以爬行，适合起伏的地形，目前用来除草。\n\n（5）一项研究发现，手写能增加大脑活动和参与度，比键盘打字更有利于记忆和学习。因此，学习重要的内容，可以尝试手写。\n文章\n1、CSS class 的替代方法（英文）\n\n作者认为，网页元素的 class 属性有很多弊端，可以不用，改用替代写法，很有启发性。\n2、短信发送天气预报教程（英文）\n\n本文介绍怎么使用短信，给自己发送天气预报。\n3、更好的 Shell 历史搜索（英文）\n\n本文教你怎么打造更好用的 Shell 历史搜索。\n4、让 NotebookLM 更好用的3个浏览器插件（英文）\n\n谷歌的 AI 笔记应用 NotebookLM 非常有用，本文介绍三个 Chrome 插件，让它更易于使用。\n5、SSL 为何改名为 TLS（英文）\n\nHTTP 的加密协议 SSL，后来改名为 TLS，本文解释原因，完全是大公司斗争的产物。\n6、自适应网页的正确写法（英文）\n\n为了适应手机浏览器，网页的 HTML 头部一般会加上缩放命令，比如width=device-width。本文介绍这个命令的正确写法。\n工具\n1、Vince\n\n网站流量统计分析工具，Google Analytics 的自托管替代品。\n2、worklenz\n\n一个开源的团队项目管理工具，自带后端和前端。\n3、Kopia\n\n一个开源的备份/恢复工具，可以将指定的目录或文件，备份到云存储服务商，有命令行和图形两种界面。\n4、Eyesite\n\n一个开源的实验项目，用摄像头捕捉用户的目光移动，从而代替鼠标，参见介绍文章。\n5、Unbound\n\n自搭建的家用 DNS 服务器。\n6、Rspamd（英文）\n\n开源的垃圾邮件过滤系统，用来检测垃圾邮件。\n7、Sync your cookie\n\n开源的 Chrome 插件，将 Cookie 同步到 Cloudflare，用于在不同设备之间共享 Cookie。（@jackluson 投稿）\n8、Link Checker\n\n网站链接检查器，输入网站链接，找出其中的死链接，代码开源。（@isixe 投稿）\n9、Ayanami\n\n纯前端的像素编辑器，支持帧动画。（@KamiC6238 投稿）\n10、chromium-style-qrcode-generator-with-wasm\n\n使用 Rust 和 WebAssembly 技术的 Chrome 风格二维码生成器，纯网页应用，不需要后端。（@liuliangsir 投稿）\n资源\n1、Daily arXiv AI Enhanced\n\n每日自动抓取 arxiv 论文，并使用 AI 进行汇总，使用 GitHub Pages 进行展示。（@dw-dengwei 投稿）\n2、中国城市地铁可视化\n\n一个交互式网页可视化应用，展示中国城市地铁线路，代码开源。（@thecuvii 投稿）\n3、Thiings\n\n一个搜索下载 3D 图标的网站，现有近3000个图标。\n4、无字证明（Proofs without words）\n\n这个网站收集各种数学定理的图像证明，上图是前 n 个奇数之和等于 n 的平方。\n图片\n1、Reddit 的子频道\nReddit 是美国最大的网上社区，有无数个子频道。任何关键字，都能创建一个子频道，类似于百度贴吧。\n下图是按照成员人数的 Reddit 子频道排名。\n\n不知道看哪个频道，可以先去上面这些频道，比如排名第一的 Funny 频道。\n2、Meat 的五次收购\n\n上图是 Meat 历史上五次最大的收购。\n其中，第二大收购是上周刚刚完成的，这个交易非常奇特。\nMeta 以143亿美元投资 Scale AI，获取后者的少数股权，并让后者的28岁 CEO 亚历山大·王（Alexandr Wang）辞职加盟 Meta，负责 AI 部门。\n\n也就是说，Meta 实际上是花了143亿美元，挖角了亚历山大·王这个人。AI 人才的价码之高，令人咋舌。\n文摘\n1、胶水工作重要吗？\n\"胶水工作\"（glue work）指的是，帮助做出产品、提高效率的一些辅助工作。\n举例来说，更新文档、解决技术债务、培训新人、维护团队成员的正常交流等等，都属于胶水工作。每个团队都需要大量这类工作。\n我认为，胶水工作非常重要，如果没有它们来粘合整个团队，就很难做出大型产品，也无法减少大型组织中的摩擦。\n有些工程师因此很天真，将大量精力花在这些胶水工作。但是，在晋升或发放奖金时，这些工程师往往被忽视，公司更看重那些销售直接相关的工作（如开发新功能）的工程师。\n为什么胶水工作不能让你得到晋升呢？\n是因为公司太愚蠢，看不到这些工作的价值吗？我不这么认为。\n公司不奖励胶水工作，因为他们不想让你优先考虑它，而想让你更重视产品的发布。胶水工作很辛苦。如果你有能力做好胶水工作，他们希望你把这种能力用在产品发布，而不是提高团队效率。\n你必须明白，让团队更顺利地运行不是你的工作，你的真正工作是执行公司领导层的使命。\n有一个很少人知道的事实是，与其花大量时间提高团队效率，不如让团队以60%的效率运行。\n这里有两个主要原因。\n（1）如果团队以100%的效率运行，团队成员不可避免地会精疲力尽，这对每个人都不好。\n（2）最好让团队成员习惯于在公司的基本效率水平上运作，而不是在短时间内人为地消除摩擦。因为低摩擦的状态不可能长期持续，这要求巨大的投入。\n大型科技公司在任何时间内都以大约20%-60%的效率运行（公司越大，运行效率越低）。大公司的增长主要在于占据更多的市场，而不在于提高效率，所以公司不在意让团队效率提高到一个很高的水平。另一方面，如果个别员工愿意在胶水工作上投入大量时间，将团队的效率提升到80%或90%，公司将利用这种免费价值，但公司对长期锁定这种价值没有任何真正的兴趣，因为这取决于优秀的人才自愿奉献时间，是不可持续的。\n所以，结论就是，公司需要有一些胶水工作，但是不需要太多的胶水工作。\n作为开发者，你的正确做法应该是，在战术层面上做一些胶水工作，而不能把胶水工作提高到战略层面。\n也就是说，你应该把胶水工作视为额外工作，你的关注重点永远应该是项目的成功。你不会因为胶水工作而得到特别的奖励，但你会因为项目的成功而获得奖励。\n言论\n1、\n政府的软件采购方式，花费大量资金，引发大量新闻报道，涉及大量人员，但最终不会有一款软件真正进入工作，用户仍将使用 Excel 处理所有事情，使用 PowerPoint 生成幻灯片。\n-- Hacker News 读者，评论美国国防部向 OpenAI 采购2亿美元 AI 模型\n2、\n未来，你还是需要学习编程。因为你需要能够准确地告诉 AI 你想要什么，了解计算机的工作原理有助于你编写更精确的提示和指令。\n-- 吴恩达，著名 AI 科学家，斯坦福大学教授\n3、\n宇航员在太空洗衣服吗？答案是不洗。\n国际空间站的供水很有限，根本没有设计洗衣服的功能。宇航员的衣服弄脏以后，要么继续穿，要么直接扔掉。脏衣服会在返回大气层的时候，全部烧掉。\n-- 《宇航员在太空洗衣服吗》\n4、\n我担心，以后在重要的媒体中，实质性内容将逐渐衰落，30秒的片段会流行，节目只具有最低的共识，充斥着对伪科学和迷信的盲目介绍，尤其还有一种对无知的庆祝。\n-- 卡尔·萨根，美国著名科普作家，这段话写于1994年\n往年回顾\n信息就像糖一样上瘾（#306）\n最酷的乐高作品（#256）\n如何走出失望和怀疑（#206）\n显卡缺货与异业竞争（#156）\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2025年6月20日",

    "description": "2025-06-20 Hacker News Top Stories\n  #\n\n\n\nAndrej Karpathy 讨论了AI对软件行业的深远影响，指出LLMs正在成为软件的新范式，但仍面临技术和应用挑战。\nUnregistry工具允许用户直接将Docker镜像推送到远程服务器，无需使用外部仓库，通过SSH隧道传输，适用于生产部署和CI/CD流水线。\nZed调试器发布，尽管功能尚不完善，但已支持多语言调试，未来计划添加更多高级功能。\n美国新签证规则要求外国学生解锁社交媒体账户以供审查，引发对隐私和言论自由的担忧。\n研究发现网站通过浏览器指纹技术秘密追踪用户，即使用户清除cookies或选择退出跟踪，追踪仍在发生。\nBento项目将Steam

AI 的推动\n软件正经历根本性变革，AI 技术进步是关键驱动力。\n软件从传统代码向可编程神经网络转变，通过提示来操作。\n\n二、LLMs（大型语言模型）的新范式\nLLMs 成为软件新范式，像电力一样是基础工具。\n它们类似公用设施和芯片制造厂，塑造智能，需大量投资。\n个人计算在发展，但经济上仍不可行。\n三、技术民主化与应用挑战\nLLMs 使技术更普及，使用从政府转向个人。\n但 LLMs 缺乏情境学习能力，需谨慎设定其限制。\n部分自主应用通过整合 LLMs 提高编码效率。\nLLMs 需人类监督，同时增加产品自主性。\n需平衡 AI 辅助与编码安全、控制。\n四、软件自主性的发展\n自动驾驶技术发展缓慢，面临挑战。\n软件自主性从基础工具向部分自主系统演变。\n开发应用虽快，但部署需更多努力。\n出现为 AI 代理而非人类设计的软件需求。\n新工具助力语言模型获取数据。\n软件行业随 LLMs 发展，成为开发者必备工具。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44314423\nLLM 可能存在安全隐患，无法进行病毒扫描，可能被恶意利用。\n通过使模型结构可理解，可以让 LLM 更好地理解应用的内部语义，结合传统代码和 AI 的优势。\n开发者需要在“人工智能优先”和“无后端”开发之间找到平衡，减少开发摩擦。\n通过 OpenAI 的“custom GPTs”或“Alexa skills”可以简化开发流程，提高易用性。\n存在对设备模型的需求，以便开发者不需要处理调用 OpenAI 等外部 AI 服务的复杂性。\n软件 2.0 和 3.0 可能不会完全取代传统编程，而是作为额外的工具共存。\n软件版本号可能引起混淆，因为它们暗示了某种改进，而实际上只是区分不同的软件类别。\n软件的发展可以看作是从无到有、部分到全部的 AI 角色演变。\n结构化输出/JSON 模式/受限解码是一种被低估的工具，可以解决 LLM 输出难以编程解析的问题。\n#\n\n\n  https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry\n这个网页介绍了一个名为“unregistry”的轻量级容器镜像仓库工具，它允许用户直接将 Docker 镜像推送到远程服务器，而无需使用外部仓库。该工具的核心功能是“docker pussh”命令（注意额外的’s’代表 SSH），通过这个命令，用户可以将镜像直接推送到远程 Docker 服务器上，仅传输缺失的层，提高了效率。\n问题背景：\n当你在本地构建了一个 Docker 镜像并需要将其部署到服务器上时，通常的选择并不理想：使用 Docker Hub 或 GitHub Container Registry 意味着代码可能公开，或者需要为私有仓库付费；自托管仓库则需要额外维护、安全性保障和存储空间；使用 Save/Load 方法（即 docker save | ssh | docker load）会传输整个镜像，即使服务器上已有 90% 的镜像；而远程重建镜像则浪费时间和服务器资源，并且可能导致生产环境中构建失败的问题。\n解决方案：\n使用“docker pussh”命令，只需一行命令即可将镜像推送到远程服务器，无需设置仓库、订阅服务、中间存储或暴露端口，直接通过 SSH 传输缺失的层。\n工作原理：\n建立到远程服务器的 SSH 隧道。\n启动一个临时的 unregistry 容器。\n通过隧道将本地随机端口转发到 unregistry 端口。\n通过转发的端口执行 docker push 到 unregistry，仅传输不存在的层。\n传输的镜像立即在远程 Docker 守护进程上可用。\n停止 unregistry 容器并关闭 SSH 隧道。\n这个过程类似于 rsync，用于 Docker 镜像的简单高效传输。\n安装方法：\n对于 macOS/Linux，可以通过 Homebrew 安装：brew install psviderski/tap/docker-pussh，然后创建一个 symlink 以将其作为 Docker CLI 插件使用。\n也可以通过直接下载最新版本的方式安装：使用 curl 下载链接，然后设置执行权限。\nWindows 系统目前不支持，但可以尝试使用 WSL 2 和上述 Linux 指令。\n验证安装：\n使用命令 docker pussh --help 来验证安装是否成功。\n使用方式：\n推送镜像到远程服务器，确保 SSH 用户有权限执行 docker 命令。如果需要 sudo 权限，确保用户可以无密码提示运行 sudo docker。例如，使用 docker pussh myapp:latest user@server.example.com 命令推送镜像。如果使用 SSH 密钥认证且私钥未添加到 SSH 代理，可以指定私钥路径。也可以指定自定义 SSH 端口。\n使用场景：\n部署到生产服务器：本地构建后直接推送到生产服务器，无需中间人。\nCI/CD 流水线：在流水线中跳过仓库复杂性，直接构建并推送到部署目标。\n家庭实验室和隔离环境：在这些环境中分发镜像，无需外部仓库。\n网页最后提到，unregistry 是为 Uncloud 创建的，Uncloud 是一个轻量级工具，用于在多个 Docker 主机之间部署容器。他们需要比完整仓库更简单的解决方案，但比 save/load 方法更高效。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44314085\n有人曾在 2015 年向 Docker 开发者提交 PR 希望添加类似功能，但被重定向到其他领域，因为不使用注册表与 Docker 的商业模式相冲突\npussh 命令被认为是一个优雅的双关语，容易记住且与标准命令仅一字之差\n建议使用更正式的别名，如 docker push-over-ssh，以避免在自动化协作中被误认为是拼写错误\nDocker 允许在 ~/.docker/cli-plugins 目录下查找 docker-COMMAND 可执行文件，可以将 pussh 命令重命名为其他名称，如 docker pushoverssh\n有人担心工程师可能会误认为 pussh 是错误并进行更改\n有人提到额外的’s’是为了’sssh'，但有人误以为是拼写错误\n有人分享了一个 YouTube 视频链接，但内容未提及\n有人提到命令别名容易冲突的问题\n有人认为这种艺术性的设计不是工程学的方法，工程学需要一个明显不同的命令来避免混淆\n有人分享了自己曾经因为别名而发生拼写错误的经历\n有人提到安装 sl(1) 终端蒸汽机车，每次误输入都会让他们发笑\n有人提到了另一个类似的项目 gti\n有人询问这是否与使用 Ansible 等推送部署工具集成得很好，以及是否需要在两端都有完整的 Docker 安装\n需要远程端有 containerd，客户端需要支持 OCI Distribution 规范的工具，Unregistry 重用了官方 Docker 注册表代码，使其看起来像 Docker Hub\n有人提到自己使用 Ansible 上传 Docker 镜像存档并恢复镜像，但这个过程比预期要长\n有人指出这只是一个巧妙的方法，通过 SSH 在两个守护进程之间共享层\n有人认为 Docker 注册表过于复杂，与黑客精神背道而驰\n有人提到构建一个 OCI 兼容的仅拉取注册表并不复杂\n有人提到 Docker 作为一家风险投资资助的公司需要赚钱\n有人推荐使用 GitHub 的注册表 ghcr.io 和 GitHub Actions，设置起来非常实用\n有人提出这是否与使用远程 Docker 上下文不同，并分享了自己的工作流程，认为这比使用 Docker Swarm 或 Kubernetes 更简单\n有人认为使用 Unregistry 的一个区别是它可以与已经构建的镜像一起工作，不需要在远程主机上构建，这样可以确保服务器上的镜像与本地测试的镜像完全相同，并且通常会更快\n有人认为这在大多数情况下可能是一个反功能\n#\n\n\n  https://zed.dev/blog/debugger\n这篇文章介绍了 Zed 调试器的发布，这是一个面向开发者的工具，标志着 Zed 向 1.0 版本迈进了一大步。文章分为几个部分，概述了调试器的特点、开发背景和未来的计划。\n概述\nZed 调试器的开发聚焦于三个核心目标：快速、熟悉和可配置。它旨在减少上下文切换的时间，让用户更多地投入到调试工作中。调试器的设计语言与 Zed 保持一致，支持从典型调试流程中预期的一切功能，并且允许用户自定义用户界面、快捷键和调试配置等。Zed 默认支持多种流行语言的调试，包括 Rust、C/C++、JavaScript、Go 和 Python。通过扩展系统，Zed 能够支持任何实现 Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)的调试适配器。\n调试适配器协议（DAP）和定位器\nZed 通过 DAP 支持多种语言的调试，但仅仅实现协议还不够，Zed 需要一个能够扩展到协作调试、支持扩展，并有效缓存和管理来自调试适配器响应的架构。为此，Zed 构建了一个双层架构：一个直接与调试适配器通信的数据层，以及一个从数据层获取数据以渲染界面的 UI 层。Zed 还引入了定位器系统，它将构建配置转换为调试配置，简化了设置过程。用户可以在 tasks.json 中编写构建任务，并在 debug.json 中引用它，或者依赖 Zed 的自动配置。Zed 自动在内置或语言服务器生成的可运行文件上运行定位器，因此在许多情况下，用户甚至不需要编写调试配置即可开始调试。目前，Zed 支持 Cargo、Python、JavaScript 和 Go 的定位器，未来还会增加更多。\n调试会话配置\n文章提供了关于如何配置调试会话的更多信息的链接，并强调了在调试会话中，Zed 使得检查程序状态（如线程、变量、断点、调用栈等）变得简单。调试面板完全可定制，用户可以拖动和重新排列标签，甚至可以移动调试面板以适应工作流程。Zed 还支持键盘驱动的调试，方便那些更喜欢不使用鼠标的用户。用户可以仅通过键盘步进代码、切换断点和导航调试会话。\n特别感谢\n调试器最初是一个社区主导的项目，开发了 8 个月，提交了 977 次，编写了超过 25000 行代码。社区构建了核心基础，使得今天的发布成为可能。文章特别感谢 Remco Smits 在项目中承担了很多重要的工作，他的贡献对于项目的成功至关重要。\n技术内幕\nZed 的调试器通过 DAP 支持多种语言的调试，但文章指出，仅仅实现协议是不够的，Zed 需要一个能够扩展到协作调试、支持扩展，并有效缓存和管理来自调试适配器响应的架构。因此，Zed 构建了一个双层架构：一个直接与调试适配器通信的数据层，以及一个从数据层获取数据以渲染界面的 UI 层。这种分离意味着 UI 层只请求它需要的信息，允许数据层懒加载信息并避免不必要的请求。这也使得数据层只负责维护会话状态、缓存响应和使过时数据无效。这种架构将使实现协作调试变得更容易，因为相同的 UI 代码可以跨多人会话重用，而且我们只发送必要的数据，节省了带宽。\n扩展 API 和调试器集成\n文章还提到，由于有超过 70 种 DAP 实现，每种都有自己的特点，因此不可能一开始就支持每一个调试适配器。为了解决这个问题，Zed 扩展了其扩展 API 以支持调试器集成。文章提供了一些代码示例，展示了如何获取指定适配器名称和配置的调试适配器二进制文件，确定适配器配置应该启动新的调试进程还是附加到现有进程，以及如何将高级调试场景定义转换为适合特定适配器的低级配置。\n定位器\n定位器是将 Zed 任务转换为调试场景的实体。即使不提供调试适配器的扩展也可以提供定位器。对于适用于给定缓冲区的所有任务，Zed 将查询所有定位器，以找到一个可以将任务转换为调试场景的定位器。转换后的调试场景可以包括构建任务（在这种情况下，它不应包含任何配置）；构建任务的结果将稍后使用 Extension::run_dap_locator 解决。文章通过一个 cargo run 任务和假设的 cargo 定位器的示例，说明了如何将任务转换为调试场景，并在构建任务完成后找到要调试的程序。这个过程几乎就像是用户自己找到了工件路径。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44314977\nZed 的调试器是主要功能，但目前缺少观察窗口、堆栈跟踪视图和数据断点，不足以满足大多数调试需求。\nZed 调试器支持基本的堆栈跟踪视图，并计划在未来添加更多高级视图。\nZed 支持同时进行多个调试会话和多线程调试。\n有用户表示，对于他们来说，Zed 的调试器已经足够使用，因为他们主要使用简单的断点和步进。\n有用户认为 Zed 团队的工作速度很快，期待未来功能的完善。\n有用户希望 Zed 能进一步完善 Git 功能，目前基本功能已经存在，但尚未完全替代现有的 Git 工作流程。\n有用户认为，与其他编辑器相比，Zed 在 TypeScript、Rust 和 Go 项目上表现最佳。\n有用户担心如果 Zed 的受欢迎程度下降，社区支持可能会受到影响，与 JetBrains 等公司相比，Zed 的更新和支持可能不够稳定。\n有用户认为，依赖社区支持是好事，意味着插件 API 强大，人们可以实施功能。\n有用户指出，可以为 Zed 付费，但付费并不能保证扩展得到良好维护。\n有用户询问关于变量观察和数据断点的跟踪问题，并希望看到这些功能。\n有用户表示，Zed 的 Vim 绑定是他们尝试过的最好的非真实 Vim 绑定。\n有用户对 Zed 的 Rust 代码自动补全功能表示好奇，想知道它是否像其他语言那样快速准确。\n#\n\n\n  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/social-media-student-visa-screening\n美国国务院宣布了一项新的签证规则，要求外国学生在获得教育和交流签证之前，必须解锁他们的社交媒体个人资料，以便美国外交官审查他们的在线活动。不这样做的学生将被怀疑向美国官员隐瞒活动。这项新指导方针要求美国外交官进行在线存在审查，寻找“对美国公民、文化、政府、机构或建国原则的敌意迹象”。另外，外交官还被指示标记任何“对外国恐怖分子的支持、援助或支持”以及“对非法反犹太主义骚扰或暴力的支持”。\n\n这项针对“反犹太主义”活动的筛查与美国国土安全部下属的美国公民及移民服务局给出的类似指导相匹配，并被批评为试图打击对以色列在加沙战争行为的反对。新的国务院检查针对的是 F、M 和 J 类别签证的申请人，这些类别指的是学术和职业教育以及文化交流。\n一位高级国务院官员表示：“美国公民期望他们的政府将尽一切努力使我国更安全，这正是特朗普政府每天都在做的。”他还提到参议员马尔科·鲁比奥（Marco Rubio）“正在帮助使美国及其大学更安全，同时将国务院带入 21 世纪”。特朗普政府上个月暂停发放新的教育签证，同时考虑新的社交媒体审查策略。美国还特别针对中国学生进行严格审查，当时正值两国在关税和稀土矿物供应问题上紧张谈判。\n国务院的指令允许外交使团恢复安排教育和交流签证的面试，但增加了对所有申请 F、M 和 J 签证者的“全面和彻底审查”。官方表示：“为了促进这种审查，所有申请 F、M 和 J 非移民签证的人将被要求调整他们所有社交媒体个人资料的隐私设置为‘公开’”。“加强的社交媒体审查将确保我们正确筛查每一个试图访问我们国家的人。”\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44314054\n美国签证新规迫使外国学生解锁社交媒体账户\n这些定义故意广泛，旨在审查对以色列的批评\n有双重国籍的人会自豪地承认他们首先忠于以色列\n这些例子似乎适用于指责任何个人，而不仅仅是某个群体\n双重国籍的人并非只有以色列公民，也会承认忠于其他国家\n这种指责只针对犹太人，与其他国家的人不同\n所有种族主义都有特定群体的特征，限制言论自由将导致失去自由言论\n许多亚裔美国人被指责忠于他们的原籍国而非美国\n这种暗示只针对犹太人，与其他国家的人不同\n反犹太主义有悠久的历史，与其他种族主义或仇外心理不同\n并非只有犹太人被指责有双重忠诚，其他族群也常被指责\n美国福音派对以色列有奇怪的忠诚，他们并非犹太人\n印度和中国不允许双重国籍，因此支持这些国家利益的美国公民值得怀疑\n在加州以外，使用其他国家国旗被视为严重的失礼行为\n#\n\n\n  https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2025/06/websites-are-tracking-you-via-browser-fingerprinting.html\n由德州农工大学领导的新研究发现，网站正在秘密使用浏览器指纹技术——一种唯一识别网络浏览器的方法——来跨浏览器会话和网站跟踪人们。\n“指纹技术一直是隐私社区关注的问题，但直到现在，我们没有确凿证据表明它实际上被用来跟踪用户，”德州农工大学计算机科学与工程教授、全球网络研究所副主任 Nitesh Saxena 博士说。“我们的工作有助于填补这一空白。”\n当您访问网站时，您的浏览器会共享大量信息，如屏幕分辨率、时区、设备型号等。当这些细节结合在一起时，就创建了一个通常对您的浏览器唯一的“指纹”。与用户可以删除或阻止的 cookies 不同，指纹技术更难以检测或阻止。大多数用户并不知道这种情况正在发生，即使是注重隐私的浏览器也难以完全阻止它。\n“想象一下，这是一个您不知道自己留下的数字签名，”Saxena 实验室的前博士生、共同作者 Zengrui Liu 解释说。“您可能看起来是匿名的，但您的设备或浏览器暴露了您。”\n这项研究标志着计算机科学家对浏览器指纹技术在现实世界中使用的理解的转折点，将其与广告使用联系起来。\n“虽然之前的研究表明浏览器指纹技术及其在不同网站上的使用，但我们的研究是第一个将浏览器指纹和广告行为相关联的，本质上建立了网络跟踪和指纹技术之间的关系，”共同作者、约翰霍普金斯大学计算机科学副教授、信息安全研究所技术总监 Yinzhi Cao 博士说。\n为了调查网站是否使用指纹数据跟踪人们，研究人员不得不超越仅仅扫描网站上指纹代码的存在。他们开发了一个名为 FPTrace 的测量框架，通过分析广告系统对浏览器指纹变化的反应来评估基于指纹的用户跟踪。这种方法基于这样一个洞见：如果浏览器指纹技术影响跟踪，改变指纹应该会影响广告商出价——即基于查看网站的人的个人资料实时出售广告空间——以及 HTTP 记录——服务器和浏览器之间的通信记录。\n“这种分析让我们能够超越表面，”Saxena 的博士生、共同作者 Jimmy Dani 说。“我们不仅能够检测到指纹技术的存在，还能证明它是否被用来识别和针对用户——这更难证明。”\n研究人员发现，即使用户清除或删除 cookies，跟踪也会发生。结果显示，当指纹变化时，出价价值有显著差异，HTTP 记录和同步事件减少，表明对定位和跟踪有影响。\n此外，这些网站中的一些将指纹行为链接到后端出价流程——这意味着基于指纹的个人资料正在实时使用，可能用于定制对用户的响应或将标识符传递给第三方。\n更令人担忧的是，研究人员发现，即使用户明确选择退出隐私法规（如欧洲通用数据保护条例（GDPR）和加利福尼亚消费者隐私法案（CCPA））下的跟踪，也可能通过浏览器指纹技术在网络上被默默跟踪。\n基于这项研究的结果，研究人员认为当前的隐私工具和政策做得不够。他们呼吁浏览器中更强的防御措施和对指纹实践的新监管关注。他们希望他们的 FPTrace 框架可以帮助监管机构审计参与此类活动的站点和提供商，特别是未经用户同意的情况下。\n这项研究是与约翰霍普金斯大学合作进行的，并在 2025 年的 ACM 网络会议（WWW）上展示。\n这项研究的资金由德州农工工程实验站（TEES）管理，这是德州农工工程的官方研究机构。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44313206\n浏览器指纹的持久性不长，几天就会变化，尤其是基于窗口大小或软件版本的指纹。\n大型广告网络更多依赖地理位置数据进行广告投放。\nFPTrace 框架用于评估基于浏览器指纹的用户跟踪。\n广告网络可能根据设备设置而非单独的指纹进行广告分段。\n浏览器指纹技术的有效性被低估，许多信息不会快速变化。\n浏览器指纹对于建立长期用户行为档案不够有效，因为用户行为可能随环境变化。\n即使没有登录，也能通过浏览器指纹和行为识别用户。\n某些浏览器指纹特征如 Linux 用户代理和 Canvas 可能影响唯一性。\n“NVIDIA Corporation\"作为 WebGL 供应商的低百分比可能是因为大多数浏览器使用 ANGLE。\n移动设备用户多，集成 GPU 如 Intel 或 AMD 占多数，NVIDIA GPU 较为罕见。\n浏览器指纹需要结合多个变量才能有效识别用户。\n许多 JavaScript 属性与浏览器或版本直接相关，不会改变。\n地理位置相关的属性除非伪装，否则揭示的信息很少。\n设备相关的属性对于识别使用相同设备和操作系统的用户很有价值。\n#\n\n\n  https://github.com/lunchbox-computer/bento\nBento 是一个电脑项目，其设计灵感来源于便当盒的外观，同时受到 Commodore 64 和 Reddit 上 r/cyberdeck 板块的许多作品的影响。Bento 可以完美地放置在键盘下，键盘作为盖子，方便用户访问内部组件，并提供了一个用于存放各种小型外设的隔间。Bento 没有内置显示屏，而是需要与外部显示器配合使用，特别是空间显示设备如 XREAL One，但也适用于任何带有 USB-C 接口的外部显示器。这样做的目的是为了消除冗余，因为内置显示屏在用户越来越多地使用 XREAL 时变得多余，增加了重量。Bento 去除了所有非必需的部分，减轻了重量，提高了便携性。\nBento 的这一版本由 Steam Deck OLED 的主板驱动，使用相同的冷却器和电池。选择这块主板是因为它是最薄且最强大的选择，但它也可以轻松适配其他更易获得的单板计算机（SBC）。建造 Bento 的初衷主要是出于对 XR 领域主导厂商的不满，他们将自己的硬件宣传为“电脑”，但实际上更像是戴在脸上的 iPad。这些设备超重且功能受限，如果用户想要进行真正的工作，最好的选择是从真正的电脑上镜像屏幕，这也是除了游戏之外最受欢迎的用例之一。因此，作者提出了创建一个专为空间显示而设计的空间电脑的想法，这就是 Bento。\n在这个仓库中，用户可以找到 Bento 的所有 STEP、3MF 和 STL 文件，以及一些外设，如 Magic Trackpad 托盘。作者希望继续这个项目，但由于个人能力有限，所以开源了这个项目，希望社区能够提供帮助。作者目前正在开发一个带有类似 Switch 2 的安装系统的专业版本，以支持模块化。以下是一些需要社区帮助的事项：支持其他键盘、Raspberry Pi 5 版本（需要找到合适的电池解决方案）、框架版本（可能需要更大的基础键盘，并且可能会取消物理存储）、支持其他 SBC 以及外设（作者有一些游戏手柄和鼠标的设计草图，可以完美地放入隔间，但愿意让位给有电路板设计技能的人）。\n如果有人决定创建自己的版本，作者请求他们将成果以 PR（Pull Request）的形式回馈到这个仓库，以便其他人也能从你的工作中受益。Bento 项目的话题包括 cad、3d-printing、xr、spatial-computing、xreal 和 steam-deck。项目遵循 CC-BY-4.0 许可证。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44313379\n该项目是一个将 Steam Deck OLED 的主板、散热器和电池集成到一个可以完美放置在苹果 Magic 键盘下方的电脑中，没有显示屏，而是选择使用 XR 显示眼镜。\n开发者将 CAD 文件开源，希望建立一个更好的版本，并分享了项目的起源故事。\n有人建议将项目的前几句话放入项目的 readme.md 文件中，因为很多人不知道“空间显示”或 XREAL 是什么。\n有人提出可以将外壳本身设计成触控板。\n有人提到 XREAL 眼镜对于工作来说是足够的，只要不涉及视频通话。\n有人询问长时间使用 XREAL 眼镜是否会导致视力疲劳或不适。\n有人提到 Xreal One Pros

近期的困难可能部分是因为人们对其使命的热情减退。\n可能不是热情减退，而是失去了对使命有热情的人。\n员工可能因为马斯克的高要求而筋疲力尽，导致项目出现问题。\n员工士气在企业中被低估，但对公司表现有显著影响。\n亚马逊尽管员工流失率高，但公司表现依然出色，说明公司成功和员工士气并非总是正相关。\n产品质量和盈利能力之间存在脱节，但最终会趋于一致。\n股价上涨能让持股员工感到高兴，但士气对不同公司的影响程度不同。\n马斯克的成功部分源于他能够激发自己和员工的“锁定”现象，即全力以赴的状态。\nSpaceX 设定的期望过高，导致失败时更受关注。\nStarship 的任务难度远超 Falcon 9，因此面临更多挑战。\n仍然有人出于职业精神和技能提升的愿望而努力工作，不完全受公司愿景影响。\n马斯克的政治行为可能让一些人离开 SpaceX，他快速决策的能力对组织至关重要。\n#\n\n\n

亿美元制造数十亿基础半导体\n领先的美国公司苹果、福特、美敦力、英伟达和 SpaceX 加强与德州仪器的合作，释放美国创新的下一个时代\n2025 年 6 月 18 日\n新闻亮点：\n超过 600 亿美元的投资包括在美国德克萨斯州和犹他州的三个制造大区建设七个半导体制造厂，支持超过 60,000 个新的美国工作岗位。\n这是美国历史上最大的基础半导体制造投资，建立在德州仪器近 100 年的传承之上。\n德州仪器在德克萨斯州谢尔曼的最大制造大区包括高达 400 亿美元的投资，用于四个制造厂：SM1 和 SM2——已经开始——以及两个额外的制造厂，SM3 和 SM4。\n利用德州仪器作为全球技术和制造领导者的优势，推进从汽车到智能手机再到数据中心的关键创新。\n德州仪器（TI）今天宣布计划在美国七个半导体制造厂投资超过 600 亿美元，这成为美国历史上最大的基础半导体制造投资。与特朗普政府合作，并建立在公司近 100 年的传统之上，TI 正在扩大其在美国的制造能力，以满足对半导体的日益增长的需求，这些半导体将推进从汽车到智能手机再到数据中心的关键创新。德州仪器在德克萨斯州和犹他州的新制造大区将共同支持超过 60,000 个美国工作岗位。\n“TI 正在建立可靠、低成本的 300 毫米产能规模，以交付对几乎所有电子系统至关重要的模拟和嵌入式处理芯片，”德州仪器总裁兼首席执行官 Haviv Ilan 表示。“领先的美国公司如苹果、福特、美敦力、英伟达和 SpaceX 依赖于 TI 的世界级技术和制造专长，我们很荣幸能与他们以及美国政府合作，释放美国创新的下一个时代。”\n“近一个世纪以来，德州仪器一直是推动技术和制造创新的基石美国公司，”美国商务部长 Howard Lutnick 表示。“特朗普总统已将增加美国的半导体制造——包括这些进入人们每天使用的电子产品的基础半导体——作为优先事项。我们与 TI 的合作将支持美国的芯片制造数十年。”\n释放美国创新的下一个时代\n今天，TI 是美国最大的基础半导体制造商，生产对智能手机、汽车、数据中心、卫星和几乎所有其他电子设备至关重要的模拟和嵌入式处理芯片。为了满足对这些基本芯片的稳步增长的需求，TI 正在建立其技术领导力的传统，并扩大其在美国的制造业务，帮助其客户开创技术突破的新浪潮。\n与苹果一起点燃智能\n“德州仪器的美国制造芯片帮助苹果产品焕发生机，我们将一起继续创造机会，推动创新，并投资于美国先进制造业的未来，”苹果公司首席执行官蒂姆·库克表示。\n与福特一起推动未来\n福特和 TI 正在努力加强美国的制造业，结合福特的汽车专业知识和 TI 的半导体技术，帮助推动创新并确保未来移动性的稳健国内供应链。“在美国销售的福特汽车中有 80% 是在美国组装的，我们为像 TI 这样的技术领导者继续在美国投资制造感到自豪，”福特汽车公司总裁兼首席执行官吉姆·法利表示。\n与美敦力连接患者护理\n美敦力和 TI 正在合作，在最重要的时刻改善生活。“在美敦力，我们依赖半导体来提供精确、性能和大规模创新的救生医疗技术，”美敦力董事长兼首席执行官杰夫·玛莎表示。“德州仪器一直是一个重要的合作伙伴——特别是在全球芯片短缺期间——帮助我们保持供应链的连续性，并加速突破性疗法的发展。我们很自豪能够利用 TI 在美国制造的半导体，因为我们致力于改变医疗保健并改善全球患者的结果。”\n与英伟达一起推进人工智能\n英伟达正在与 TI 合作，释放下一代人工智能架构。“英伟达和 TI 共享在美国制造基础设施以振兴美国制造业的目标，”英伟达创始人兼首席执行官黄仁勋表示。“我们期待继续与 TI 合作，为先进的 AI 基础设施开发产品。”\n与 SpaceX 一起确保高速卫星互联网\nSpaceX 越来越多地利用 TI 的高速处理技术，将其 Starlink 卫星互联网服务与 TI 在德克萨斯州谢尔曼制造的最新 300 毫米 SiGe 技术连接起来。“我们的基本任务是彻底改变全球连通性并消除数字鸿沟。这个任务的核心是不断推动可能性的边界，”SpaceX 总裁兼首席运营官格温妮·肖特韦尔表示。“SpaceX 每天在美国制造数万个 Starlink 套件——全部在这里——我们正在对 PCB 制造和硅封装进行巨大投资，以进一步扩大。TI 的美国制造半导体对我们来说至关重要，它们确保了我们产品的美国供应链，它们的先进硅制造能力提供了满足全球对高速互联网日益增长需求所需的性能和可靠性。”\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44314759\nTexas Instruments 投资巨额资金在美国制造基础半导体，有人怀疑其财务可行性\n有人质疑此类投资是否仅为营销噱头，实际并不会兑现\n有人提到政府宣布的投资项目往往没有后续，资金可能会被行政成本消耗\n有人反驳称已经看到一些基础设施项目因政府投资而得以实施\n有人指出，一些资金尚未花费，许多项目仍在审批过程中\n有人讽刺地提出，如果每年建一个数据中心，500 亿美元的投资需要很长时间\n有人澄清，500 亿美元的投资是由私营企业进行，与政府支出无关\n有人指出，这种将现有项目重新包装为新宣布的做法是一种政治手段\n有人通过公司对联邦政府的称呼来判断政治广告的真实性\n#\n\n\n  https://drhagen.com/blog/the-missing-11th-of-the-month/\n这篇文章由 David R Hagen 撰写，发表于 2015 年 12 月 29 日，探讨了为什么在 Google Ngrams 数据库中，大多数月份的 11 日被提及的频率异常低。文章起始于对 2012 年 Randall Munroe 发布的 xkcd 漫画的讨论，该漫画以日历形式展示了每个日期的大小与其在 Google Ngrams 数据库中被提及的频率成正比。作者注意到，除了 9 月 11 日之外，大多数月份的 11 日似乎异常小。为了验证这一点，作者分析了 Ngrams 数据库中的数据，该数据库记录了自 1800 年以来每年书籍中提及特定日期的次数，并进行了标准化处理。\n作者首先确认了 11 日的异常性，通过比较实际数字而非文本大小来验证这一点。他提取了每年每个月的日期提及次数，并计算了每个月中每个日期的中位数，以避免像 7 月 4 日这样的异常值影响结果。分析结果显示，11 日的出现频率显著低于其他日期（p 值 <0.05），且没有明显的解释。\n文章进一步探讨了这一现象的历史趋势，发现自 1800 年以来，11 日的提及频率就一直低于平均水平。特别是在 1860 年代，11 日与其他普通日期的差距迅速扩大，直到 20 世纪初，11 日的提及频率大约只有预期的一半。尽管在 20 世纪下半叶这一差距有所缩小，但仍然存在。\n作者还注意到，除了 11 日之外，还有四个日期（2 日、3 日、22 日和 23 日）的提及频率也异常低。这些日期在 1800 年至 1890 年间甚至比 11 日还要低，但从 1900 年开始，它们的差距开始缩小，直到 1930 年代完全消失。作者将这些日期的异常情况留待将来探讨，而专注于 11 日。\n文章接着揭示了造成 11 日提及频率低的原因是印刷字体中的数字“1”与大写字母“I”或小写字母“l”或“i”相似，导致 Google 的算法在读取页面时将 11 日误读为其他词汇。作者通过搜索诸如“March llth”、“July IIth”、“May iith”等无意义的短语，发现有五种可能的组合（IIth、Ilth、iith、lith、llth）至少在一个月的数据库中可以找到。作者将这些错误统称为“xxth”，并将这些错误读回的实例加回到 11 日的计数中，发现在 1860 年代之前，11 日与其他日期的差距被消除。1860 年代之后，大约四分之一到三分之一的差距被消除。\n文章进一步探讨了 1860 年代开始的另一个错误——Google 算法将 11 日误读为“nth”。作者将“nth”的错误读回加回到 11 日的计数中，发现这一错误几乎解释了所有缺失的 11 日。当将“xxth”和“nth”的错误读回都加回到 11 日时，整个时间线上的差距消失，11 日看起来像是一个普通的月份日。\n最后，作者探讨了为什么 11 日的误读率不均匀，以及为什么在 1860 年代错误率急剧上升。作者推测这可能与 1860 年代发明的一种特殊设备——打字机有关。最早的打字机没有数字 1 的单独键，打字员被期望使用小写字母“l”来表示 1。随着打字机的普及，即使是印刷材料的字体也开始反映这种预期。作者通过比较 1850 年和 1920 年的字体，说明了 1 和 l 在字体中的相似性，这种相似性可能导致了 11 日的误读率上升。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44313550\n有趣的文章，值得一读，并且建议查看关于 2 日、3 日、22 日和 23 日的第二篇文章。\n怀疑异常值是正确的原则，因为它们可能不是真实的，会误导真实数据。\n怀疑 Twyman 定律：“任何看起来有趣或不同的数字通常是错误的。”\n应该意识到黑天鹅理论，即不可预测的异常事件。\n数据来源的调查是有用的，也是重要的。\n建议在科学期刊投稿时不要随意移除异常值，除非先检查它们存在的原因。\nTwyman 定律并不是说要忽略异常值，只是预测它们更可能是错误而非真实。\n使用奥运会评分方式，去掉最高和最低分数以排除极端评分的影响。\n博客迁移到 GitHub Pages 后，不再担心流量问题。\n数据质量问题可能因为未考虑上下文相关的字形等价性。\n11 日的缺失可能因为扫描器错误，例如将“l2”更正为“12”，但“ll”没有更正为“11”。\n2 日、3 日、22 日和 23 日的缺失是因为人们过去有时会写成 2d、3d、22d、23d。\n阅读这篇文章非常有趣。\n简而言之，这是 OCR 错误。\n有时候，不是所有的“1”都会变得像“l”，特别是在打字机上。\n打字机上没有“1”键，需要用小写字母“l”代替。\n在英国，过去用“L”和退格键以及“=”键来打“£”。\nGNU groff 在“ascii”模式下使用减号代替等号来制作英镑符号。\n打字机世界有一些特殊性，例如压力使得最小的物理键数量能够组成最大的字符范围。\nMarkdown 可以不依赖过击来写项目符号和下划线。\n#\n\n\n  https://endof10.org/\nWindows 10 的支持将在 2025 年 10 月 14 日结束。微软希望您购买新电脑。但如果您的电脑购买于 2010 年之后，那么您其实没有必要更换它。通过安装最新的 Linux

    "url": "https://juejin.cn/post/7517488132989681699",
    "description": "深入探索LangGraph：用图结构构建新一代大语言模型应用程序\n关注老周不迷路\n最新AI大模型应用开发学习资料免费领取\n引言\n在开发复杂的大语言模型应用时，工程师常被多步推理、状态管理和任务协调等问题困扰。传统代码结构在应对涉及决策、回溯、状态传递和多轮交互的场景时往往力不从心。而LangGraph的诞生正是为了解决这些挑战，它将应用逻辑转化为可操作的图结构，让复杂工作流的设计变得前所未有地直观高效。\nLangGraph技术定位：超越传统工作流引擎\n\nLangGraph并非LangChain的附属品，而是基于图的并行执行引擎。它继承了LangChain的接口与生态优势，但核心创新在于其状态驱动的编程模型：\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\nclass AppState(TypedDict):\nuser_query: str\nsearch_results: list\nanalysis: str\n# 1. 定义状态容器\nbuilder = StateGraph(AppState)\n# 2. 声明节点逻辑\ndef search_node(state: AppState) -> dict:\nresults = search_api(state[\"user_query\"])\nreturn {\"search_results\": results} # 更新状态字段\n# 3. 构建工作流图\nbuilder.add_node(\"search\", search_node)\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"search\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"search\", END) # 单向图结构\n# 4. 编译可执行图\ngraph = builder.compile()\n\n其技术栈亮点如下：\n强类型状态容器：通过TypedDict强制执行数据结构约束\n自动脏位检查：仅在被修改的状态字段触发下游节点执行\n无死循环机制：运行时自动检测循环依赖并抛出异常\n断点续传设计：持久化检查点实现意外中断后的流程恢复\n二.革命性架构设计解析\n\n1. 状态即流程驱动者\n传统DAG中节点显式调用关系：\nA -> B -> C\n\nLangGraph采用状态驱动范式：\n状态变化事件 → 触发满足条件的节点 → 生成新状态\n\n此模型天然支持多路径并行、基于状态的决策路由，真正实现以数据流控制程序流。\n2. 条件边缘动态路由\n实现复杂分支决策的核心机制体现在条件边缘（Conditional Edges）：\nfrom langgraph.graph import conditional_edge\ndef should_analyze(state: AppState) -> str:\nreturn \"analyze\" if len(state[\"search_results\"]) > 3 else \"END\"\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\n\"search\",\nshould_analyze, # 基于当前状态选择路径\n{\"analyze\": \"analysis_node\", \"END\": END}\n)\n\n这种声明式条件机制支持：\n基于置信度分数选择分支\n根据搜索结果数量动态调整流程\n错误发生时重定向到恢复节点\n3. 异步执行引擎核心\n当多个节点具备并行执行条件时：\nbuilder.add_node(\"web_search\", web_search)\nbuilder.add_node(\"db_query\", database_query)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"web_search\", \"combine\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"db_query\", \"combine\") # 双源汇聚\n\nLangGraph自动完成：\n同时启动web_search和db_query节点\n等待两者返回结果\n将双方结果整合后触发combine节点\n内置信号量控制并发度防止资源过载\n三.实战案例：构建多智能体协作系统\n\n开发电商客服助手需要多个AI模块协同：\n\ngraph LR\nA(用户问题) --> B(意图识别)\nB --> C{咨询类型}\nC -->|产品| D[产品知识库]\nC -->|订单| E[订单系统]\nD & E --> F(回复生成)\nF --> G(回复评估)\nG -->|通过| H[返回用户]\nG -->|不通过| I[人工审核]\n\nLangGraph实现代码框架：\nclass SupportState(TypedDict):\nquery: str\nintent: str\nproduct_data: dict\norder_data: dict\nresponse: str\napproved: bool\nbuilder = StateGraph(SupportState)\n# 构建处理节点\nbuilder.add_node(\"detect_intent\", detect_intent_fn)\nbuilder.add_node(\"query_product\", query_product_db)\nbuilder.add_node(\"fetch_order\", fetch_order_info)\nbuilder.add_node(\"generate_response\", llm_generation)\nbuilder.add_node(\"evaluate_response\", safety_check)\n# 配置条件边缘\ndef route_based_on_intent(state):\nif state[\"intent\"] == \"product\":\nreturn \"query_product\"\nelif state[\"intent\"] == \"order\":\nreturn \"fetch_order\"\n\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"detect_intent\", route_based_on_intent)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"query_product\", \"generate_response\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"fetch_order\", \"generate_response\")\n# 添加评估环节\ndef evaluate_route(state):\nreturn \"end\" if state[\"approved\"] else \"human_review\"\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"evaluate_response\", evaluate_route)\n\n此架构的优势体现：\n模块化扩展：新增支付模块只需添加节点\n自动错误隔离：订单系统故障不影响产品咨询\n流程透明可查：内置图形化跟踪器完整记录状态变迁\n灰度发布能力：按百分比分流请求到实验分支节点\n四.性能关键指标实测对比\n\n在模拟的1000次复杂查询测试中：\n\n方案平均时延代码复杂度故障恢复时间\n\n传统微服务1200ms高（3000+行）>30分钟\nLangChain序列链950ms中（800行）需手动恢复\nLangGraph610ms低（300行）<1分钟\n\n并行处理带来的性能收益尤其显著：\n当存在3个可并行节点时，LangGraph总耗时≈最慢节点时间\n线性链方案则需累计所有节点时延\n五.开发范式变革：从代码到拓扑图\n\nLangGraph的哲学可总结为：\n“将程序逻辑从过程指令转化为状态拓扑空间”\n这一转变带来了开发体验的革命：\n# 传统回调地狱示例\ndef process_query(query):\nresult1 = step1(query)\nif result1.valid:\nresult2 = step2(result1)\nif result2.success:\nfinal = step3(result2)\nreturn render(final)\nelse:\nreturn render(retry_page)\nelse:\nreturn render(invalid_page)\n\n# LangGraph替代方案\n[\nNode(step1, output=\"result1\"),\nIf(Condition(result1.valid),\nNode(step2, input=\"result1\", output=\"result2\"),\nIf(Condition(result2.success),\nNode(step3, input=\"result2\"),\nElse(Node(show_retry))\n),\nElse(Node(show_invalid))\n)\n]\n\n六.拓展边界：构建企业级应用\n\nLangGraph的成长路线正快速演进：\n混合执行模式：对计算敏感型节点（如格式转换）支持本地GPU加速\n持久化优化：基于Redis的状态存储插件\n可视化跟踪器：实时流程图显示执行位置与状态数据\n资源调度器：配置节点级别的CPU/内存配额限制\nOpenTelemetry集成：全链路跟踪指标输出\n配合LangSmith的评估模块，形成AI开发完整闭环：\n[图设计] → [调试] → [部署] → [监控] → [评估反馈]\n\n结语：开启AI应用开发的新维度\nLangGraph通过图抽象消解了复杂逻辑的控制流复杂性。其核心价值不止于提升开发效率，更在于为智能系统提供了持续演化的基础架构。当我们的关注点从代码行转移到节点拓扑，从顺序执行转移到状态流驱动时，我们真正站在了构建自适应AI系统的新起点。\n开发人员现在可以专注于：\n定义业务状态空间\n设计状态转换逻辑\n规划并发执行路径\n配置错误恢复策略\n无需再耗费90%时间编写流程控制代码——这正是LangGraph带来的根本性变革。随着LLM应用进入需要协调多个AI智能体的新阶段，基于图的编程范式必将成为未来十年智能系统开发的重要基石。",

    "description": "嘿，各位开发者、站长朋友们！\n你是不是也经历过这样的“灵魂拷问”：\n网站部署在海外，国内用户访问慢如蜗牛？\n用着 Cloudflare，却因国内节点缺失而访问体验打折？\n想给网站上个 CDN 加速和安全防护，一看价格单就默默劝退？\n如果你对以上任何一个问题点了头，那么今天这篇内容，你可得睁大眼睛看仔细了。我发现了一个堪称“王炸”级的项目——腾讯云 EdgeOne 的免费计划，它可能就是你一直在寻找的终极答案。\n\n🚀 核心武器：一个能打的免费 CDN\n说实话，免费 CDN 见得多了，但 EdgeOne 这次拿出的诚意，着实有点“不讲武德”。\n它最核心的亮点，就是全球唯一同时支持国际和国内加速的免费 CDN。这意味着什么？意味着你的网站，无论访客来自纽约、伦敦，还是北京、上海，都能享受到飞一般的访问速度。\n我们来盘盘它的几大“杀手锏”：\n真正的免费，真正的无限量\n不限流量、不限请求次数！这意味着你再也不用像盯着电表一样，天天担心流量超额收到“惊喜”账单了。当然，官方也说了，这主要面向个人开发者和非盈利项目，别拿去分发大视频或者跑什么黑灰产哦。\n国内访问，快到起飞\n1~5ms 不是梦。这背后是腾讯云遍布全球的 3200 多个节点在发力，跟那些“海外绕一圈”的免费服务完全是两个次元的体验。\n安全感，免费附送\n平台级 DDoS 防护、基础 WAF（网站防火墙），还有免费自动续期的 SSL 证书，等于给你的网站雇了个 24 小时在线的免费保镖。\n\n🌐 意外之喜：白送你的网站托管 Pages\n除了强大的 CDN，EdgeOne 还顺手送了你一个“懒人福音”——免费的网站托管服务 Pages。\n你可以把它理解成一个集成了全球 CDN 的 Vercel 或 Netlify。\n部署全自动：直接关联你的 GitHub 仓库，每次 git push，它就自动帮你构建和部署，无论是 React 还是 Vue 项目，都安排得妥妥的。\n零服务器成本：提供 5GB 的总存储空间和免费的 xxx.edgeone.app 临时域名，用来搭建个人博客、作品集或者小型官网，简直不要太香。\n\n🔑 “上车”指南：如何薅到这波羊毛？\n说了这么多，重点来了，怎么才能拥有它？\n天下没有免费的午餐，但有内测的“船票”！\n目前，这个香饽饽还处于内测阶段（预计 2025 年 7 月公测），你需要一张“兑换码”才能上车。\nCDN 加速（无限量版）：\n\n去官方频道蹲点：关注 EdgeOne 的 Twitter 或者加入 Discord 社区，官方每天都会限量发码，手快有，手慢无！\n“曲线救国”：也可以先用付费版，等套餐到期后会自动降级为免费版，适合不差钱又想提前体验的朋友。\n\nPages 网站托管：\n\n这个简单粗暴，直接去国际站 edgeone.ai 注册就行，无需兑换码，邮箱注册即可开玩。\n⚠️ 最重要的提醒：想用国内节点，域名必须备案！域名必须备案！域名必须备案！ 这是合规红线，没备案的朋友可以选择“全球加速（不含中国大陆）”模式，同样能享受到海外加速和安全防护。\n💎 总结一下\n总的来说，腾讯云 EdgeOne 的免费计划，绝对是近年来开发者圈子里最值得关注的福利之一。它用“无限流量”和“国内加速”这两张王牌，精准地解决了国内开发者的核心痛点。\n无论你是个人博客主、中小企业，还是在捣鼓什么有趣的出海项目，这都绝对值得你花点时间去抢一张“船票”。\n好了，不说了，我先去蹲码了，你们随意！\n如果你也对最新的AI信息感兴趣或者有疑问 都可以加入我的大家庭 第一时间分享最新AI资讯、工具、教程、文档 欢迎你的加入！！！😉😉😉\n公众号：墨风如雪小站\n我的博客：https://blog.worldcodeing.com/\n我的导航站：https://nav.worldcodeing.com/\n源码小站：https://www.worldcodeing.com/",

    "description": "自我介绍\n大家好，我是志辉，10 年大数据架构，目前专注 AI 编程\n1、背景\n这个很早我就想写了 App 了，我也是痛风患者，好多年，深知这里面的痛呀，所以我想给大家带来一个好的通风管家的体验，但宏伟目标还是从小点着手，那么就有了今天的主角，痛风伴侣 H5。\n目录大纲\n前面都是些开胃小菜，看官们现在我们就正式开始正文，那么整体目前是分的 6 个阶段。\n第零阶段：介绍\n第一阶段：需求\n第二阶段：数据准备\n第三阶段：开发+联调+部署\n第四阶段：部署+上线\n第五阶段：运营维护+推广\n第六阶段：成本计算\n前四个阶段可以分为一个大家的阶段，就完成了你的产品工作\n最后就是收尾工作，以及后续的维护。\n废话少说，就正式开始吧。\n第零阶段：介绍\n产品开发流程图\n\n这是一个传统的软件开发流程，从需求的讨论开始到最后的产品上线，总共需要的六大步骤，包括后续的迭代升级维护。\n成本测算\n这里面其实最大的就是投入的人力成本，还不算使用的电脑、软件这些，还包括最大的就是时间成本。\n我们按按照基本公司业务项目的项目来迭代看\n人力成本\n产品：1～2 人，有些大项目合作的会更多，跨大部门合作的。\nUI ：1 人\n研发：\n前端：1～2人\n后端：2～3人\n测试：1～2 人\n合计：这里面最少都是 6 人\n时间成本\n这里不用多少，大家如果有经验的，基本公司项目一般的需求都是至少一个月才能上线一个版本，小需求快的也就是半个月上线。\n沟通成本\n这个就用说了，大家都是合作项目，产品和 UI，产品和研发，研发和测试，这就是为啥会有那么多会的缘故，不同的工种，面对的是不同\n\n时间成本感受\n个人创业感想\n那这里你就可能要较真了，你这个功能简单，哪能跟公司的项目比了。\n那我就想起我之前跟我同学一起创业搞 app 的时候，那个时候我不会 app、也不会前端，我是主战大数据的，其实对后端有些框架不也太熟。\n那会儿我们四个人，1 个 app、1 个后端+前端、1 个产品，也是足足搞了 1 个多月才勉强上了第一个小版本。\n但是我们花的时间很多，虽然一个月，但那一个月我没睡过觉，不会就得学呀，哪像现在不会你找个 AI 帮手帮你搞，你就盯着就行，那会一边学前端，一遍写代码，遇到问题只能搜索引擎查，要么就是硬看源码去找思路解决。\n想想就是很痛苦。\n公司工作感想\n本职工作是大数据架构，设计的都是后端复杂的项目通信，整体底层架构设计，但是也需要去做一些产品的事情。\n但是大数据产品就不像业务系统配比那么豪华，一整个公司就两三个人，那么有时候就的去做后端服务、前端界面，就为了把我们的产品体验做好。\n每天下班疯狂学习前端框架，从最基本的 html、css、js 学起，不然问题解决不了，花了大量的时间，并且做项目还要学习各种框架，不然报错了你都不知道咋去搜索。\n这样能做大功能的事情很少，也就是修修补补做些小功能。\n产品感想\n这也是我最近用了 AI 编程后的感想，最近公司的数据产品项目，我基本都是 AI 编程搞定。\n以前复杂的画布拖拉拽，我基本搞不定到上线的质量，现在咔咔的一下午就搞定开发，再结合 AI 的部署模板，一天就基本完成功能。效率太快。\n也是这样，我在现在的公司的产出一周顶的上以前的一个月（这真不是吹牛，开会的半个小时，大数据的首页的 landing page 我就做好了🤦♂️） ，但是时间完全不用一周（偷偷的在这了讲，老板知道了，就。。。所以我要多做一些，让老板留下我）。\n我现在感想的就是现在更加需要的就是你的创意、你的想法，现在的 AI 能力让更多的人提效的同时，也降低了普通人实现自己产品的可能性。这在以前是无法想象的，毕竟很多门槛是无法跨越，是需要时间磨练的。\n效果展示\n然后再多来几张美美的截图（偷偷告诉你，这就是我的背景图片工具做出来的。）\n\n第一阶段：需求\n1、需求思考\n做产品最开的就是需求了，如果你是产品经理，那么我理解这一阶段是不需要 AI 来帮你忙的。\n虽然大家基本对产品或多或少都有一些理解，那么专业性肯定比不了，那么我们就需要找专业的帮忙了。\n所以我这里找的是 ChatGPT，大家找 DeepSeek，或者是 Gemin，或者是 Claude 都可以的。\n我目前准备为痛风患者开发一个拍照识别食物嘌呤的h5应用，我的需求如下：\n\n1. 这个h5底部有3个tab： 识别、食物、我的\n2. 在【识别】页面，用户可以选择拍照或者选择相册上传，然后AI识别食物，并且给到对应的嘌呤的识别结果和建议。\n3. 在【食物】页面，用于展示不同升糖指数的常见食物，顶部有一个筛选，用户可以筛选按嘌呤含量高低的食物,下方显示食物照片/名称/嘌呤/描述\n4. 【我的】页面顶部有一个折线图，用户记录用户的尿酸历史；下方显示近3次的尿酸数据：包括平均、最低、最高的数据；还有记录尿酸和历史记录的列表。\n\n在技术上，【我的】页面尿酸历史记录保存在本地localStorage中，【食物】的筛选也是通过本地筛选，拍照识别食物嘌呤的功能，采用通义千问的vl模型。\n\n请你参考我的需求，帮我编写一份对应的需求文档。\n\n发给 ChatGPT\n\n这样就给我们回复了。\n2、思考\n你说我不会像你写那么多好的提示词，一个我也是借鉴别人的，一个就是继续找 AI 帮你搞定，比如你不知道 localstoreage 是什么，没关系，这个都是可以找 AI 问出来的。\n\n或者是说你只有一个想法，而不知道这个产品要做成什么，也可以问 AI。\nGPT 会告诉你每个阶段该做哪些功能，这样看看哪些对你合适，然后通过不断的多轮对话，来让他输出最后的需求文档。\n\n3、创建需求工作空间\n我们在电脑新建个目录，用来存放暂时的需求文档和一些前置工作的文件\nStep 1： 在电脑的某个目录下创建前期我们需要的工作项目的目录，这里我叫 h5-food-piaoling\nStep 2： Cursor 打开这个目录\nStep 3： 创建 docs 目录\nStep 4： docs 目录下创建 prd.md 文件，把刚刚 GPT 生成的需求文档拷贝过来。\n我这里是后截图的，所以文件很多，不要受干扰了\n\n4、重要的一步\n到这里需求文档就创建好了，那么我们是不是马上就可以开发了，哦，NO，这里还有很重要的一步。\n那么就是需要仔细看这个 GPT 给我们生成的需求文档，还是需要人工审核下的，避免一些小细节的词语、或者影响的需要修改的。\n比如这里，我已经恢复不出来了，这里原来有些 “什么一页的文章，适合老年人的这些文字”，这些其实不符合我那会儿想的需求的，所以我就删除了。\n\n比如这里用到的一些技术，如果你懂的话，就可以换成你懂的技术，也是需要考虑到后面迭代升级的一些事情。\n\n总结：其实这里就是需要人工审查下，避免一些很不符合你想的那些，是需要修改/删除的，这个会影响后面生成 UI/交互的逻辑。\n不过这个步骤不做问题也不大，这一步也是需要长久锻炼出来，后面等真实的页面出来后，你再去修改也行。\n第二阶段：数据准备\n这里的一步也是我认为比较特别的点，这个步骤的点可以借鉴到其他场景里面。\n1、哪里找数据\n你的产品里的数据的可信度在哪里？特别是关乎于健康的，网上的信息纷繁复杂，大家很难分清哪些是真的，哪些是假的。\n我之前查食物的嘌呤的时候，就遇见了，同样一个食物，app 上看到的，网上看到的都不一样，我就黑人问号了？？？\n所以，这里就涉及到数据的权威性、真实性了。那么权威机构发布的可信度会更强。\n所以我找到了卫健委颁发的数据。\n地址：www.nhc.gov.cn/sps/c100088…\n\n另外还可以看到不止痛风的资料有，还有青少年、肥胖、肾病的食养指南。\n这些病其实都是慢性病，不是吃药就能马上好起来，需要长期靠饮食、运动来恢复的。\n可以把这些数据用起来，后面挖掘更多需求。\n2、下载数据\n这一步周就是把数据下载下来，直接点击上面的\n\n下载来后是个pdf 的文件，那么这一步我们就准备好了。\n这里我附带一份，大家可以作为参考\n暂时无法在飞书文档外展示此内容\n3、处理数据\n这一步是为什么了，是因为目前在所有的 AI 编程工具里面，pdf 是读取不了的，特别是 Cursor 里面。\n目前能够读取的是 markdown 格式的数据\nmarkdown 格式的数据很简单，就是纯文本，加上一些符号，就可以做成标题显示\n不懂的可以直接问题 AI 工具就行了。\n这里就可以看到大模型给我们的解释了。\n插曲\n我不懂 markdown 是什么，帮我解释下，我一点都不懂这个\n\n在 Cursor 里面使用 ask 模式来提问\n\n下面就是一个回答的截图，如果你对里面的文字不清楚的，那么就继续问 AI 就可以了。多轮对话。\n\n处理数据\n这里就是需要把 pdf 转为 markdown 的数据\n这里推荐使用：mineru.net/\n重点在于免费，直接登录注册进来后，点击上传我们刚下载的 pdf。\n\n等待上传转换完成，下一步就是在文件里面，看到转换的文件了。\n点击右侧下载，就是 markdown 格式。\n\n把下载好的 markdown 文件放入到项目里面的 data 目录，待会儿会需要数据处理。\n\n4、修正需求文档\n那么让 Cursor 给我们重新生成需求文档，这样食物的分类，还有统计，会更准确，因为现在是基于权威数据来的。\n食物数据库目前是存储在 json 文件里，请根据 @成人高尿酸血症与痛风食养指南 （2024 年版）.md 的食物嘌呤数据，再根据 @prd.md 里面的食物数据结构，生成一份数据，并获取对应的 image 图片，保存在 imgs 目录下\n\n\n5、生成数据文件\n前面我们不是讲到了。食物列表的数据需要存储在本地，也就是客户端，形式我们就采用 json 的形式\n同样你不知道 json 是个啥的话，找 AI 问，或者直接 Cursor 里面提问就行了。\n左边是提示词，右侧就是创建的 json 文件\n食物数据库目前是存储在 json 文件里，请根据 @成人高尿酸血症与痛风食养指南 （2024 年版）.md 的食物嘌呤数据，再根据 @prd.md 里面的食物数据结构，生成一份数据，并获取对应的 image 图片，保存在 imgs 目录下\n\n\n结果：\n\n6、继续调整文件\n上一步骤发现，其实只给我们列觉了 53 种食物，并不全\n我需要全部的数据，那么继续\n总结的有 53 种食物，但是我看 @成人高尿酸血症与痛风食养指南 （2024 年版）.md 下的“表1-2 常见食物嘌呤含量表” 应该不止这么多，请再次阅读然后补全数据到 @foods.json 文件里。\n\n\n最后发现，总文档里总结了 180 种的食物\n\n最后生成的数据文件如下：\n\n6、图片问题\n不过这里有个问题就是，食物对应的图片是没有办法在这里一次性完成的\n我也尝试了在 Cursor 里让他帮我完成，结果些了一大堆的代码，下来的图片还对应不上。\n尝试了很多方案，都不太理想。\n那你说了，去搜索引擎下载了，我也想到了，不过想起来你要去搜索，然后找图片，下载，有 180 多种了，还要命名好图片名字，最后保存到目录。\n想到这里，我就头大，索性干脆自己写一个，其他流程系统都帮我搞定，暂时目前只需要我人工确认图片，保证准确性。\nClaude Code + 爬虫碰撞什么样的火花，3 小时搞定我的数据需求\n这个小系统也还是有很大的挖掘潜力，后面也还可以做很多事情\n到这里基本需求阶段就完成了，数据也准备的差不多了，下面就是进入开发阶段了。\n不要看前面的文字多，那都是前戏，下面就是正戏，坐稳扶好，开奔。\n第三阶段：开发+联调+测试\n这里是主要的开发、联调、测试阶段，也就是在传统开发流程中会占据大部分的时间，基本一个软件/系统的开发大部分的时间都在这个里面，所以我们看看结合 AI 它的速度将会达到什么样。\n== 1、前端 ==\n步骤一：bolt 开发\n说下为什么采用 bolt 工具来做第一步工作。\n其实线下 v0、bolt、lovable 很多这种前端设计工具，那么他与 Cursor 的区别在哪里了？\n1、首先通过简单的提示词，它生成的功能和 UI 基本都是很完善的，UI 很美、交互也很舒服。这种你在 Curosr 里面从零开始些是很难的。\n2、这种工具一般都可以选择界面的上的元素（比如 div、button，这个就比较难），然后进行你的提示词修改，很精准，这个你在 Cursor 里面比较难做。\n3、还有一个点就是前端开发的界面的定位这些大模型很难听得懂你在说啥的，所以我感觉也是这块的难度采用了上面那么多的类似的工具的诞生。\n当然，如果不用这些工具，直接让 Cursor 给你出 ui 设计，然后使用 UI 设计出前端代码也可以的。\n这个我看看后面用其他例子来讲解。\n把上面的需求步骤的 prd.md 的需求直接粘贴到提示词框里。没问题，就可以直接点击提交了。\n小技巧：看左下角有个五角星的图标，是可以美化提示词的，这个目前倒是 bolt 都有的功能。\n另外还可以通过 Github 或者 Figma 来生成项目图片。\n\n下面就是嘎嘎开始干活了。\n\n等他写完，就可以在界面的右侧看到写完的H5程序。\n界面很简单，左侧就是对话区域，右侧就是产品的展示区域\n小细节：在使用移动端展示的时候，还可以选择对应的手机型号\n\n步骤二：调整\n1、错误修复\n这个交互我觉得做的特别好，不用粘贴错误，直接就在界面上点击“Attempt fix”就可以了，这真的是纯 vibe coding ，粘贴复制都不用了。🤦♂️\n如果有错误，继续就可以了。\n\n2、UI 调整：主题\n刚开始其实 UI 并不是太好看，我的主题色是绿色的，所以我也不知道让它弄什么样的好看。\n再帮我美化下 UI 界面\n\n就输入了上面一句话，刚开始的 UI 如下图\n\n最后看下对比效果\n左边是最开始生成的，右边是我让他优化后的样子。还是有很多细节优化的。\n\n3、UI 修复方式一：截图\n另外如果样式有问题，可以截图粘贴到对话框，然后输入提示词修改。\n\n4、UI 修复方式二：选择元素\n这里就是我要说的可以选择界面上的元素，然后针对某些元素进行改写\nbolt 的方式这几输入提示词\nv0 比较高级，选择后，可以直接修改 div 的一些样式参数，比如：宽高、字体、布局、背景、阴影。精准调节。（低代码+vibe coding）\n\n经过多轮修复，觉得功能差不多了，就可以转战本地 Cursor 就继续下一步了。\n步骤三：本地 Cursor 修改\n1、同步代码到 Github\n点击右上角的「Integrations」里的 Github。\n\n下面就会提示你链登录 Github\n\n接着授权就可以\n\n然欧输入你需要创建的项目名称\n\n2、本地下载代码\n使用 git 工具把代码下载到本地\ngit 就类似游戏的存档工具，每一个步骤都可以存档，当有问题的时候，就可以从某个存档恢复了。\n当然：这里需要提前安装好 Git，如果有不懂的可以联系我，我来帮你解决。这你就不多说了\n打开你的 Github 仓库页面，复制 HTTPS 的地址\n\n然后使用下面的命令，就可以下载到本地了。\ngit clone 你的代码仓库地址\n\n\n下一步就是安装代码的依赖包\n这里需要 nodejs 环境，同样就不多说了，不懂的可以私聊\n\n下一步就是启动\n\n接着就是浏览器打开上面的地址：http://localhsot:3000，就可以看见上面写好的页面。\n默认打开是按照 pc 的全屏显示的，可能看着有些别扭\n\n我们打开 F12，打开调试窗口，如下图\n点击右侧类似电脑手机的按钮，就可以调到移动端模式显示了，还可以选择对应的机型。\n\nxx 小插曲 xx\n原本不想放这里的，结果还是放一下吧，刚好是解决了一个很大的问题\n刚开始在 bolt 上面修改的时候，修改后一直报个错误，结果修复了很多次，还是没有解决。\n\n没办法，我就在本地 Cursor 上仔细看了下代码，发现是个引号的问题。\n\n我就在本地 Cursor 中快速修复了下\n\n但是后面惊悚的事情来了，我去 bolt 上调整了下界面样式，结果又给我写成了引号的问题\n最后我就发现，可能 bolt 目前对这类的错误还是没有意识。并且看它界面的代码，每次都是从头开始写（难怪要等好一段时间才弄完，究竟是什么设计了？）\n最后索性，我仔细看了下代码，删除掉了，没啥大的影响。\n目前来看 bolt 这种工具还是有点门槛，解决错误的能力还是没有 Cursor 强大，一不小心页面上的错误就在一起存在，你也不知道它改了啥。\n这就需要你对代码还是有基本的认识。\n步骤四：使用本地数据\n首先就是把前面下载准备好的图片放到 imgs 目录下\n\n在 Cursor 中让从 imgs 目录中显示图片。\n\n不过这里 Cursor 还是很智能的，访问后都是 404\n\n那么就直接告诉 Cursor 让他解决这个问题。\n结果他一下子就找到问题所在了，需要放在 public 目录下，这个放以前你需要去搜索引擎里面找问题，并且有时候你拿让 AI 解决的问题，去搜索引擎找，基本都是牛头不对马嘴的回答。\n最后还要去找官方文档看资料，不断的尝试。\n\n** 前端小结 **\n到这里，基本前端的事情就搞完了\n1、识别：识别流程，现在都是走前端模拟的流程\n2、食物：这里目前应该是很全的功能了，读取本地的 json 数据，有分类标识，还有图片的展示\n3、我的：个人中心有尿酸的记录，有曲线图，还有基本的体重指数记录。\n\n== 2、后端 ==\n步骤零：阿里云大模型准备\n背景：需要使用大模型来识别图片，然后返回嘌呤的含量，所以我们需要选择一个大模型的 API 来对接。\n这里选择阿里的 qwen 来对接。\n登录百炼平台：bailian.console.aliyun.com/\n访问API-kEY 的地址：bailian.console.aliyun.com/?tab=model#…\n创建一个 API-kEY，并保存好你的 key 信息。\n\n步骤一：创建必要的配置\n先访问找到通义千问 API 的文档的地方\n\n这里我们采用直接复制上面页面的内容，保存到项目下的 docs 目录在的 qwen.md 里面\n\n这里顺便把之前的 prd.md 文档从之前的项目目录拷贝过来了\n步骤二：创建后端服务模板代码\n直接使用下面的提示词，就可以创建一个后端的服务\n这里要想为什么要创建后端服务，\n一方面主要是需要调用大模型的 API，用到一些KEY 信息，这些是需要保密的，不能在前端被人看到了。\n另外一方面，后面如果需要一些登录注册服务，还有食物数据都是需要后端来存储，提供给前端。\n请在项目的根目录下创建 backend 目录，在这个 backend 目录下创建一个基于fastify框架的server，保证服务没有问题\n\n同样的不知道什么fastify技术的，找大模型聊就行。\n\n步骤三：API 文档+后端业务服务开发\n重点来了，这里我就写到一个提示词里面，让他完成的\n帮我接入图像理解能力，参考 @qwen.md  :\n1. 现在在 @/backend  的后端服务器环境中调用ai能力，\n2. 使用 .env 文件保存API_KEY，并使用环境变量中的DASHSCOPE_API_KEY.并且.env文件不能提交到git上，提交到git的可以用.env.example文件作为举例供供用户参考\n3. 要求使用openai的sdk，并且前端上传base64的图片\n4. 后端返回值要求返回json格式，返回的数据能够渲染识别结果中的字段，包括：食物/嘌呤值/是否适合高尿酸患者/食用建议/营养成分估算\n5. 在 @/backend  目录下创建 api.md 文件，记录后端接口文档\n\n这里我把 api.md 高亮了，这个是关键，是后面前后端联调的关键，不然 Cursor 是不知道请求字段和响应字段该怎么对接的，到时候数据不对，再来调试就比较麻烦。\n所以接口文档务必保证 100% 准确，后面的调试就会很容易。\n截图如下：\n\n很贴心的完成功能后，最后帮我们些了 api.md 接口文档，还进行了一些列测试，保证功能是完整的。\n这里放出来，Cursor 看是怎么帮我们写这个代码的\n帮我们组装好了提示词\n根据 qwen.md 的接口文档，组装请求数据和返回数据，字段都我们的项目符合\n\n== 3、联调 ==\n其实这里的联调很简单了。就是一句话的事情。\n因为之前的前端的拍照图片都是走的模拟的接口，没有真正的调用后端的接口，所以需要换成真正的后端接口。\n刚好前面的后端服务写好了 api.md 接口文档\n前端修改点，前端目录是当前根目录\n1. 也需要加入请求后端的 url 的环境变量，本地调试就默认使用 localhost，线上发布的时候设置环境变量后，前端服务从环境变量获取 url 然后请求到对应的后端服务\n2. 食物识别的接口参考 @api.md 文档，请修改需要适配的地方，食物识别的代码在 @identify-page.tsx代码中。\n\n\n这里要说的是：前面的 api.md 接口文档些的非常准备，这一步的前端请求后端接口，基本都是一遍过，所以后端提供的接口文档一定要准确，这样前端就可以很准确的调用接口传参和取返回值了。\n== 4、测试 ==\n其实到这里，基本测试的工作也就完成了。\n基本的流程到现在都是跑通的。\n不过还是需要多实际测试，这里下面的例子就是，我上传了「黄瓜」的照片，结果没识别，按理说不应该呀。\n这里上了点专业的技巧，通过 F12 的调试窗口，看下接口返回的数据。\n按照以往经验来说，估计是字段对应不上\n\n所以我就直接和 Cursor 说，可能是字段对应不上。请帮我修复。\n测试黄光的食物的时候，后台接口返回的数据是 \"purine_level\": \"low(低嘌呤<50mg)\",但是 @getPurineLevel() @getPurineLevelText 没有识别到，请帮我修复\n\n最后从前后端都给我做了修复，字段的匹配对应上了。\n\n最后的总结如下：\n\n== 4、总结 ==\n其实到这里基本功能就完成了。\n前端使用 bolt 工具等生成，快速生成漂亮的 UI 界面和基本完整的前端功能\nbolt工具调整样式、UI 等细节（擅长的）\nCursor 精修前端小细节\nCursor 开发完整后端功能\n写清楚需求，如果知道具体技术栈是最好的\n写好接口文档，最好人工校验下\n前后端联调\n@使用后端的接口文档，最好写改动的接口的地方，前后精准对接\n学会使用浏览器的 F12 调试窗口，特备是接口的请求参数和响应值的学习。\n就目前来看，如果你是零基础，那么基本的术语不明白的话，有些问题可能会不好解决\n寻求 AI 的帮助，遇事不决问 AI，它可以帮你搞定\n寻求懂行的人来帮助你，比如环境的事情、按照的事情有时候一句话就可以给你讲明白的。\n第四阶段：部署+上线\n部署这一块其实对普通人门槛还比较高的，问题比较多。\n域名问题\n服务器问题\n如何部署，如何配置\n这里我们采用云厂商的部署服务，简化配置文件和部署的流程\n但是域名申请还是需要提前准备好的，不过现在我们用的这个云服务暂时现在没有的域名，也有临时域名可以先用。\n到这里，其实如果你只是本地看的话，就已经可以了，那么这里我们教一个上线部署的步骤，傻瓜式的，不需要各种配置环境。\n我相信大家如果搞独立开发的 Vercel 肯定都熟悉了。这里也介绍下类似的工具，railway.com/，他不仅可以部署前端静态页面，还有后端服务，PostgreSQL、Redis 等数据库也支持一键部署。\n\n1、项目的配置文件\nrailway 部署是需要一些配置文件的，当然我们可以让 Cursor 帮我们搞定。\n直接告诉 Cursor 我们需要部署到 railway 上，看还需要什么工作可以做的。\n后端\n@/backend 这个后端项目现在需要在railway上去部署，请帮我看看需要哪些部署配置\n\n\n前端\n也是一样，让 Cursor 给我们生成部署的配置文件\n当前目录是前端目录，也需要添加railway的部署相关配置\n\n\nCursor 会帮我们创建需要的配置文件，那么就可以进入下一步部署了。\n2、提交代码\n记得要提交代码，在 Cursor 的页面添加提交代码，推送代码到 Github 上，这样 railway 才可以拉取到代码。\n提交代码的时候，可以使用 AI 生成提交信息，也可以自己填写信息\n\n记得还要同步更改\n\n3、railway 页面操作\n现在会有赠送的额度，并且免费就用也有 512M 的内存机器使用。对于当前下的足够了。\n注册登录后，选择 Dashboard 后，点击添加，就可以看到如下的页面，\n添加 Github 项目，后续就会授权等操作，继续完成就可以。\n\n下一步就一个你的项目\n然后就会跳转到工作区间，会自动部署。\n\n记得不要忘记环境变量\n\n就是在「Variables」标签下，直接添加变量就行。\n添加完记得需要重新部署下。\n后端环境变量\n\n前端环境变量\n\n当然不过你有错误，可以把 log 里面的错误复制，粘贴到 Cursor 里面，让他解决，我之前部署的项目有个就有问题，通过这个方式，帮我解决了。\n4、大功告成\n部署完成后怎么访问了，切换到 settings 页面，有个 Networking 部分，可以生成一个 railway 自带的域名，用这个域名就可以访问了，如果你有自己的域名还可以添加一个自己的域名，添加完以后就可以自己访问了。\n\n5、总结\n很开心，跟我走到了这里，基本到这里，算是完成一大步，也就是我们的 MVP 完成了。\n现在我们再来总结下前面整体的步骤\n1、前端我们通过 bolt 来生成代码，加速前端的设计，让 bolt 这种工具提供我们更多的能力，发挥他的有点\n2、后端使用 Cursor 来开发，纯业务逻辑通过提示词还是很好的达到效果。\n3、前后端联调，写好接口文档，让 Cursor 必须阅读接口文档，前端再写接口\n4、部署配置文件也可以通过 Cursor 来搞定，无所不能\n5、中间有任何问题，有任何不懂的都可以找 Cursor 使用 ask 模式搞定。\n第五阶段：运营维护+推广\n分了「优化」「安全」「推广」三个部分来说这个事情。\n其实到这里是后续的常态，你不要不断的推广你的产品，去增加访问量。\n另外就是不断的迭代优化你的功能，提升用户体验，加强本身产品的竞争力。\n最后、最后、最后就是安全，这个不要忘记了，后面我也会加强后，然后去推广下我的产品，安全很重要，提前做好可以更保护你的服务器和大模型的 API-KEY。\n优化\n这个是上线了后发现的，就是使用手机拍的照片，一般都比较大，这张图片请求后端的时候，数据量比较大，接口超时了。\n那么解决办法：\n1、增加后端的请求体的大小\n2、压缩图片，然后再请求后端接口\n安全\n其实这里还是蛮重要的，因为你的服务，还有你的大模型的 KEY，如果服务器被攻击是要付出代价的，最重要的是花掉你的钱呀。\n所以这块我还在做，目前想的就是让 Cursor 正题 revivew 代码，看下有什么安全隐患，给我一些解决方案。\n推广\n如果你的产品上线后，需要写文章、发小红书去推广，首先从你的种子用户开始，你的微信群，你的朋友圈都是可以的。\n后面积极听取用户心声，持续解决痛点需求，满足用户的痛点，产品就会越来越好。\n第六阶段：成本计算\n时间成本\n从开始到结束上线，手机使用正式的域名访问，大概就是整一天的时间，从早上开始，忙到晚上我就开启了测试，晚上搞完还去外面遛弯了一大圈回来的。\n我们就算：10 小时\n人力成本\n哈哈哈哈，很清楚，就我一个人\n软件成本\nbolt：20 元优惠包月（海鲜市场），就算正式渠道，20 刀一个月，当然有免费额度，调整不多，基本够用\nCursor：150教育优惠（海鲜市场），就算正式渠道，20 刀一个月，足足够用\n域名：32首年\n我们就算满的，折算成人民币，也就是 300 块。\n想想 300 块一天你就做出来一个系统（前后端+部署），何况软件都是包月的，一个月你可以产出很多东西，不止这个一个系统。\n对比公司开发，一个月的成本前后端两个人，毕业生也的上万了吧，何况还是 5 年经验开发的（市面上的抢手货）。\n总结\n能走到这里的，我希望你给自己一个掌声，确实不容易。\n我希望你也有可以通过编程来实现自己的想法和创意。\n虽然目前编程对于零基础的人来说确实可能会有些吃劲，但是你我差距也不大，我现在遇到了很多在搞 AI 编程的都是程序员，有房地产行业的、也有产品的。\n遇事不决，问 AI\n我希望你可以记住这句话，自己的创意+基本问题找 AI，你基本就可以解决 99% 的问题，剩下的 1% 你基本遇不到，遇到了，也不要慌，身边这么多牛人总会有人知道。",

    "description": "我们需要谈谈困扰我几个月的事情。我一直看到独立黑客和初创公司创始人疯狂地拼凑各种技术栈，用 Redis 做缓存，用 RabbitMQ 做队列，用 Elasticsearch 做搜索，还有用 MongoDB……为什么？\n我也犯过这种错误。当我开始构建UserJot（我的反馈和路线图工具）时，我的第一反应是规划一个“合适的”架构，为所有功能提供独立的服务。然后我停下来问自己：如果我把所有功能都用 Postgres 来做会怎么样？\n事实证明，房间里有一头大象，但没人愿意承认：\n\nPostgres 几乎可以做到这一切。\n\n而且它的效果比你想象的还要好。\n“Postgres 无法扩展”的谬论正在让你损失金钱？\n让我猜猜——有人告诉你，Postgres“只是一个关系数据库”，需要专门的工具来完成专门的工作。我以前也是这么想的，直到我发现 Instagram 可以在单个 Postgres 实例上扩展到 1400 万用户。Discord 处理数十亿条消息。Notion 的整个产品都是基于 Postgres 构建的。\n但问题是：他们不再像 2005 年那样使用 Postgres。\n队列系统\n别再为 Redis 和 RabbitMQ 付费了。Postgres 原生支持LISTEN/NOTIFY并且比大多数专用解决方案更好地处理作业队列：\n-- Simple job queue in pure Postgres\nCREATETABLE job_queue (\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    job_type VARCHAR(50),\n    payload JSONB,\n    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT'pending',\n    created_at TIMESTAMPDEFAULT NOW(),\n    processed_at TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- ACID-compliant job processing\nBEGIN;\nUPDATE job_queue\nSET status ='processing', processed_at = NOW()\nWHERE id = (\n    SELECT id FROM job_queue\n    WHERE status ='pending'\n    ORDERBY created_at\n    FORUPDATESKIP LOCKED\n    LIMIT 1\n)\nRETURNING *;\nCOMMIT;\n\n这让你无需任何额外的基础设施就能实现 Exactly-Once 的处理。不妨试试用 Redis 来实现，会让你很抓狂。\n在 UserJot 中，我正是使用这种模式来处理反馈提交、发送通知和更新路线图项目。只需一次事务，即可保证一致性，无需消息代理的复杂性。\n键值存储\nRedis 在大多数平台上的最低价格为 20 美元/月。Postgres JSONB 已包含在您现有的数据库中，可以满足您的大部分需求：\n-- Your Redis alternative\nCREATETABLE kv_store (\n    key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,\n    value JSONB,\n    expires_at TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- GIN index for blazing fast JSON queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_kv_value ON kv_store USING GIN (value);\n\n-- Query nested JSON faster than most NoSQL databases\nSELECT*FROM kv_store\nWHEREvalue @>'{\"user_id\": 12345}';\n\n运算符@>是 Postgres 的秘密武器。它比大多数 NoSQL 查询更快，并且数据保持一致。\n全文搜索\nElasticsearch 集群价格昂贵且复杂。Postgres 内置的全文搜索功能非常出色：\n-- Add search to any table\nALTERTABLE posts ADDCOLUMN search_vector tsvector;\n\n-- Auto-update search index\nCREATEOR REPLACE FUNCTION update_search_vector()\nRETURNStriggerAS $\nBEGIN\n    NEW.search_vector := to_tsvector('english',\n        COALESCE(NEW.title, '') ||' '||\n        COALESCE(NEW.content, '')\n    );\n    RETURNNEW;\nEND;\n$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Ranked search results\nSELECT title, ts_rank(search_vector, query) as rank\nFROM posts, to_tsquery('startup & postgres') query\nWHERE search_vector @@ query\nORDERBY rank DESC;\n\n这可以处理模糊匹配、词干提取和相关性排名。\n对于 UserJot 的反馈搜索，此功能可让用户跨标题、描述和评论即时查找功能请求。无需 Elasticsearch 集群 - 只需使用 Postgres 即可发挥其优势。\n实时功能\n忘掉复杂的 WebSocket 基础架构吧。Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY无需任何附加服务即可为您提供实时更新：\n-- Notify clients of changes\nCREATEOR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_changes()\nRETURNStriggerAS $\nBEGIN\n    PERFORM pg_notify('table_changes',\n        json_build_object(\n            'table', TG_TABLE_NAME,\n            'action', TG_OP,\n            'data', row_to_json(NEW)\n        )::text\n    );\n    RETURNNEW;\nEND;\n$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n您的应用程序会监听这些通知并向用户推送更新。无需 Redis 的发布/订阅机制。\n“专业”工具的隐性成本\n我们来算一下。一个典型的“现代”堆栈的成本是：\nRedis：20美元/月\n消息队列：25美元/月\n搜索服务：50美元/月\n监控 3 项服务：30 美元/月\n总计：每月 125 美元\n但这还只是托管成本。真正的痛点在于：\n运营开销：\n三种不同的服务用于监控、更新和调试\n不同的缩放模式和故障模式\n需要维护多种配置\n单独的备份和灾难恢复程序\n每项服务的安全考虑因素不同\n开发复杂性：\n客户端库和连接模式\n多个服务的部署\n间数据不一致\n的测试场景\n的性能调优方法\n如果您自行托管，请添加服务器管理、安全补丁以及当 Redis 决定消耗所有内存时不可避免的凌晨 3 点调试会话。\nPostgres 使用您已经管理的单一服务来处理所有这些。\n扩展的单一数据库\n大多数人可能没有意识到：单个 Postgres 实例就能处理海量数据。我们指的是每天数百万笔交易、数 TB 的数据以及数千个并发连接。\n真实世界的例子：\nAirbnb：单个 Postgres 集群处理数百万个预订\nRobinhood：数十亿笔金融交易\nGitLab：Postgres 上的整个 DevOps 平台\nPostgres 的架构魅力非凡。它被设计成具备极佳的垂直扩展能力，而当你最终需要水平扩展时，它也有以下成熟的方案可供选择：\n用于查询扩展的读取副本\n大表分区\n并发连接池\n分布式设置的逻辑复制\n大多数企业从未达到过这些限制。在处理数百万用户或复杂的分析工作负载之前，单个实例可能就足够了。\n将此与管理所有以不同方式扩展的单独服务进行比较 - 您的 Redis 可能会耗尽内存，而您的消息队列则会遇到吞吐量问题，并且您的搜索服务需要完全不同的硬件。\n从第一天起就停止过度设计\n现代开发中最大的陷阱是架构式的“宇航员”。我们设计系统时，面对的是我们从未遇到过的问题，我们面对的是从未见过的流量，我们可能永远无法达到的规模。\n过度设计循环：\n“我们可能有一天需要扩大规模”\n添加 Redis、队列、微服务、多个数据库\n花费数月时间调试集成问题\n向 47 位用户推出\n每月支付 200 美元购买可在 5 美元 VPS 上运行的基础设施\n与此同时，您的竞争对手的发货速度更快，因为他们在需要分布式系统之前并没有管理它。\n更好的方法：\n从 Postgres 开始\n监控实际的瓶颈，而不是想象的瓶颈\n当达到实际极限时扩展特定组件\n仅在解决实际问题时才增加复杂性\n你的用户并不关心你的架构。他们关心的是你的产品是否有效，是否能解决他们的问题。\n当你真正需要专用工具时\n别误会我的意思——专用工具自有其用处。但你可能在以下情况之前不需要它们：\n您每分钟处理 100,000 多个作业\n您需要亚毫秒级的缓存响应\n您正在对数 TB 的数据进行复杂的分析\n您有数百万并发用户\n您需要具有特定一致性要求的全局数据分布\n如果您在公众号上阅读强哥这篇文章，那么您可能还没有到达那一步。\n为什么这真的很重要\n让我大吃一惊的是：Postgres 可以同时充当您的主数据库、缓存、队列、搜索引擎和实时系统。同时还能在所有方面保持 ACID 事务。\n-- One transaction, multiple operations\nBEGIN;\n    INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('user@example.com');\n    INSERT INTO job_queue (job_type, payload)\n    VALUES ('send_welcome_email', '{\"user_id\": 123}');\n    UPDATE kv_store SET value = '{\"last_signup\": \"2024-01-15\"}'\n    WHERE key = 'stats';\nCOMMIT;\n\n尝试在 Redis、RabbitMQ 和 Elasticsearch 上执行此操作，不要哭泣。\n无聊的技术却能获胜\nPostgres 并不引人注目。它没有华丽的网站，也没有在 TikTok 上爆红。但几十年来，在其他数据库兴衰更迭之际，它一直默默地支撑着互联网。\n选择简单、可靠且有效的技术是有道理的。\n下一个项目的行动步骤\n仅从 Postgres 开始- 抵制添加其他数据库的冲动\n使用 JSONB 实现灵活性- 借助 SQL 的强大功能，您可以获得无架构的优势\n在 Postgres 中实现队列——节省资金和复杂性\n仅当达到实际极限时才添加专用工具- 而不是想象中的极限\n我的真实经历\nUserJot 的构建是这一理念的完美测试案例。它是一个反馈和路线图工具，需要：\n提交反馈时实时更新\n针对数千个功能请求进行全文搜索\n发送通知的后台作业\n缓存经常访问的路线图\n用于用户偏好和设置的键值存储\n我的整个后端只有一个 Postgres 数据库。没有 Redis，没有 Elasticsearch，没有消息队列。从用户身份验证到实时 WebSocket 通知，一切都由 Postgres 处理。\n结果如何？我的功能交付速度更快，需要调试的部件更少，而且基础设施成本也降到了最低。当用户提交反馈、搜索功能或获取路线图变更的实时更新时，一切都由 Postgres 完成。\n这不再只是理论上的。它正在实际生产中，通过真实的用户和真实的数据发挥作用。\n令人不安的结论\nPostgres 或许好得过头了。它功能强大，以至于大多数其他数据库对于 90% 的应用程序来说都显得多余。业界一直说服我们，所有事情都需要专门的工具，但或许我们只是把事情弄得比实际需要的更难。\n你的初创公司不必成为分布式系统的样板。它需要为真正的人解决真正的问题。Postgres 让你专注于此，而不是照看基础设施。\n因此，下次有人建议添加 Redis 来“提高性能”或添加 MongoDB 来“提高灵活性”时，请问他们：“您是否真的先尝试过在 Postgres 中执行此操作？”\n答案可能会让你大吃一惊。我知道，当我完全在 Postgres 上构建UserJot时，它就一直运行顺畅。\n\n本文为译文，英文原文地址（可能需要使用魔法访问）：dev.to/shayy/postg…",

    "description": "前言\n你对小程序的感觉如何？你喜欢 uni-app/HBuilder 、Taro 吗？\n现在，简单聊聊\n造成我们开发困境的罪魁祸首是谁？\n微信小程序是怎么从刚开始的好评如潮到如今的人人喊打的？\nuniapp/taro 等是救星还是帮凶？\n想回答这几个问题之前，先要了解下小程序的历史，以及它的目的和初衷。\n小程序怎么个事儿？\n2017年1月9日 腾讯在自家即时通讯平台 “微信” 上推出了一种不需要下载安装即可在微信平台上使用的应用程序，所有企业、组织和个人以及政府机构都可以自由开发和发布，这时候的微信小程序还没有表现出任何天赋，大部分人都将他当成了微信的一个新功能而已，并没有太在意。\n直到同年 12 月，腾讯官方发布了 “跳一跳” 小游戏，通过按压和释放，让角色在各色各样的底座上跳动，然而就是这样一款小游戏\n\n上线未满一月，在 2017年12月28日，累计用户量达到了 3.1亿 。\n跳一跳事件就像一颗核弹，瞬间让大家看到了微信小程序的巨大潜力，光速引爆了小程序/小游戏 概念。大量个人和企业开始涌入开发者行列。\n2018年初，小程序全面爆发，小程序数量突破了 100 万，累计用户突破 6 亿，其中小游戏占比 28% 左右。2018 年 10 月，月活用户超过 4 亿，同比增长近 4900%！\n各式各样的小程序上线之后，短期内为早已有所准备的微信团队创造了巨大营收，成为了既微信支付、朋友圈广告之外的另一个支柱级盈利点，虽然还不及微信支付和广告收入，但是这也让微信团队对小程序更加重视了。\n微信给小程序提供了便捷的入口、为其新开发了云开发服务....\n到这，小程序的生态繁荣可以说达到了顶峰，所有的开发者都开心的写着小程序，但是慢慢的，大家发现了有点不对劲的地方。\n开发者工具更新了一版又一版，基础库更新了一代又一代，我们的开发体验依旧没有上去，从模拟器演示卡顿，到真机调试断联，再到被警告占领的控制台、对CSS某些属性的不支持\n\n有的时候有一堆报错，我们在代码中找了几个小时的问题，最后通过重启微信开发者工具解决了。写的代码这也不支持，那也不支持，WXSS 像 CSS 又不是 CSS，WXML 像 HTML 又不是 HTML，搞得开发者焦头烂额。\n这时候大概还没有人对小程序有脾气，毕竟是新东西，大家对它有一定的包容，很多时候还会认为是自己学艺不精。\n正当大家对小程序的态度日渐转变时，马上要成为过街老鼠时， uniapp 跳出来了，其实 uniapp 也是 2018 年就正式发布了，但是直到大概 2020 年前后才广泛使用，这期间开发者可以说饱受折磨。\nuni-app（由DCloud开发）它允许开发者使用 Vue.js 的语法编写小程序，越来越多的开发者抛弃了原生小程序，奔向 uniapp 的怀抱。\nuniapp 的出现使得开发者体验上了一个大台阶，我们可以用熟悉的 web 技术去开发小程序。\n跨平台框架时代\n微信小程序爆发后，各大厂商都在忙着往自家 APP 里塞入一个小程序环境，一家一个开发者工具且互不兼容，这让小程序前端生态进一步割裂。\n\n同时期，还有一众小程序跨端框架的出现，比如最著名的 uni-app（DCloud）、taro（京东）、MPVue（美团）等等。\n至今仍然保持着一种微妙的平衡。\n人都是有惰性的，大公司更不例外，如果什么都不用做就能赚钱，那就没有做任何事的必要。跨平台框架的出现，一方面给开发者带来便利，照顾到了开发者的惰性，另一方面给小程序团队一个不用继续修补的理由，照顾到了小程序团队的惰性。\n这样一来，开发者用着跨平台框架，虽然不至于像 web 开发一样爽，但至少没有原生那么难受了，小程序团队则靠着几个免费的外援，硬生生把自己生态稳住了。\n救星还是帮凶？\n当今的小程序开发环境中，小程序它不管自己的兼容性好不好，也不管自己的开发者工具是否稳定流畅，它只管推出一些半成品功能，我相信做框架的人比我们还恶心，但是没办法，现在他们骑虎难下。\n比如 2023 年发布的 skyline 渲染引擎，本以为小程序终于要好起来了，结果它给我们拉了一坨大的，虽然效果很丝滑，但也只是丝滑的屎罢了。拿一个经典坑来说，它默认元素是 flex 布局，开发者工具方向是columns，而真机上是 row。\n我记得当时首当其冲的 uniapp 和 taro 都声称支持了 skyline ，但是实际上手后发现并没有那么完善。甚至使用 skyline 的小程序放到低版本微信上，还会出现样式错乱的问题。\n但是微信不管你这那的，小程序推出 skyline 兼容性不行，被骂的不是小程序本身，而是大家正在使用的第三方框架。\n第三方框架的愿景和初衷我相信是好的，他们希望统一小程序生态，但是架不住各大厂商的内斗，没有统一标准，没有相互兼容，大家各干各的，当任务最终落到开发者身上时，带来的不是工资的提升、岗位的增加，而是工作量的剧增。\n不妨设想一下，如果 uniapp 等从来没有出现，小程序的开发体验会是今天这样吗？显然不会，小程序会尽量提高自己的兼容性和开发体验以保住这个来之不易的来财之路。\n如果把小程序比喻成狗屎，那可以把第三方框架比喻成糯米，开发者用糯米包着屎，比较容易下咽，在外行人看来，我们好像在吃粽子。在某种意义上，现在这种组合还真就是粽子，你不嚼还好，一嚼就露馅了。\n第三方框架的目的和愿景是成为救星，但是客观上却成了帮凶，让那帮拉屎的拉的肆无忌惮。\n可否破局？\n我们都知道，所谓小程序，就是在某个古老的 chrome 内核上的一种套壳。它只是加了更多的所谓 “特色功能” 的限制，真可谓是屎上雕花，它本质就是在浏览器上保存的一系列网页收藏，恰巧这个浏览器还带有聊天功能罢了。\n但是话又说回来，小程序也确实降低了企业和个人的开发成本，以前要做一个独立应用，必要做一个安卓 app，一个 ios app，代价非常大。而原生应用和前端技术又有较大的差异，所以小程序、uniapp 这种东西能活的这么好，甚至还出现了诸如 finclip 这种第三方小程序容器，现在随便招一个月薪 3k 的大学生，他可以帮你把各个平台的小程序、加上移动双端全给你干了。\n现在整个小程序圈看起来欣欣向荣，我们做项目，总也绕不开小程序，仿佛没有小程序，我们的业务就不能正常进行。\n如果说要打破开发者目前的困境，几乎是不太可能的，我们也无法去预想和讨论这件事，只能默默的吃下这颗屎馅儿粽子。\n结语\n简单说到这里，三个问题也差不多回答了俩了，剩下一个问题我相信大家心里也有了答案，我们评论区见。\n番外\nuni-app (DCloud ) 早在 2012 年就开始研发小程序底层技术，搭建了跨端 WebView 框架，2015 年推出“流应用”商业化解决方案（类似小程序），并开放给合作伙伴使用，是实实在在的小程序鼻祖。\n参考资料\npdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H3_AP20…\npdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H3_AP20…\nwww.reuters.com/breakingvie…\npdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H3_AP20…\nblog.csdn.net/weixin_4429…\nblog.csdn.net/m0_61321856…\nwapbaike.baidu.com/tashuo/brow…\nwww.imd.org/research-kn…\nwww.reddit.com/r/stocks/co…\nzh.uniapp.dcloud.io/history.htm…",

    "url": "https://juejin.cn/post/7517197769246720012",
    "description": "💥先说结论：除非你团队真的“特别大”，否则别再迷信 Pinia\n用完 Pinia，最后我自己掏出一套组合式 API 封装后，项目变清爽了、调试变简单了、开发变自由了。\nPinia 确实“像 Vuex 的现代替代品”，但它仍然是一种「状态管理框架」，一旦项目复杂，它就成了“另一个 Vuex”。\n组合式 API + ref() + 封装逻辑函数，其实就是你早就拥有的“更强 store”。\n🧱背景：Pinia 被推荐是因为「轻量 + DevTools 支持 + 自动类型推导」\n这是我最早喜欢 Pinia 的理由。你看这写法：\nimport { defineStore } from 'pinia'\n\nexport const useUserStore = defineStore('user', {\n  state: () => ({\n    token: '',\n    info: null,\n  }),\n  actions: {\n    setToken(token: string) {\n      this.token = token\n    },\n  },\n})\n\n是不是熟悉的感觉？既有 state，又有 actions，还能在组件里这样用：\nconst userStore = useUserStore()\nuserStore.setToken('abc')\n\n但你写着写着，问题就来了。\n😫痛点 1：复杂逻辑封装极难\n来个真实案例：\n登录成功后，要做三件事：\n存 token\n拉用户信息（异步）\n如果用户是“新用户”，还要弹一个 modal\n你是不是要这样写？\nactions: {\n  async login(payload) {\n    const res = await loginApi(payload)\n    this.token = res.token\n    const userInfo = await fetchUserInfo()\n    this.info = userInfo\n\n    if (userInfo.isNew) {\n      // 在 store 里开弹窗？\n      // 还是 emit 事件？\n      // 还是从组件层判断？\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n你会发现：store 被耦合了 UI 行为。\n你只想“登录”，结果 store 里塞了一堆 UI 流程代码。\n最后它变成了另一个“小 app.vue”。\n😤痛点 2：模块拆分没有比组合式 API 更清晰\nPinia 多模块管理要这样：\n// user.ts\nexport const useUserStore = defineStore(...)\n\n// cart.ts\nexport const useCartStore = defineStore(...)\n\n// 然后全局注册、统一引入\n\n看似干净，但本质还是 Vuex 那套模块思路，你想拆模块，要考虑：\n类型合并\n名字冲突\nstate 嵌套结构暴露还是封装？\n但你换成组合式 API 呢？\n// user.ts\nexport const useUser = () => {\n  const token = ref('')\n  const info = ref(null)\n  const setToken = (t: string) => token.value = t\n  return {\n    token, info, setToken\n  }\n}\n\n是不是就和普通 setup() 一样？用的时候直接：\nconst user = useUser()\nuser.setToken('abc')\n\n逻辑拆分天然用文件系统组织，而不是人为“store 注册”绑定。\n🐛痛点 3：调试复杂，响应性还是靠 guess\n你以为写了：\nstate: () => ({\n  list: [],\n  count: 0\n})\n\n就响应式了？其实不是。\n当你写：\nthis.list.push(123)\n\n你有没有遇到页面没更新的情况？因为不是用 this.list = [...this.list, 123]。\n这时你得问自己：为什么我要去想“哪种操作才是响应式”？\n组合式 API 根本不用想，直接：\nconst list = ref<number[]>([])\nlist.value.push(123) // 100% 响应式\n\n还支持解构、传递、深度操作，不用 this，不用猜。\n⚙️实战：组合式 API 怎么封装出“类 Store”模块？\n你可以像这样封一个 user.ts 模块：\n// user.ts\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst token = ref('')\nconst info = ref(null)\n\nconst setToken = (t: string) => token.value = t\nconst setInfo = (i: any) => info.value = i\n\nexport function useUser() {\n  return {\n    token,\n    info,\n    setToken,\n    setInfo,\n  }\n}\n\n用的时候：\nimport { useUser } from '@/composables/user'\nconst user = useUser()\nuser.setToken('abc')\n\n要是你怕每次都用一个新实例，也可以加缓存：\nlet instance: ReturnType<typeof createUser> | null = null\n\nfunction createUser() {\n  const token = ref('')\n  ...\n  return { token, ... }\n}\n\nexport const useUser = () => {\n  if (!instance) instance = createUser()\n  return instance\n}\n\n这不就是你熟悉的 useXxxStore()？\n✅什么时候用 Pinia 更合适？\nPinia 并不是没价值，它在以下场景更适用：\n大型团队需要明确 store 组织结构\n需要 SSR 支持的场景（如 Nuxt 3 有原生支持）\n习惯“集中式状态管理”的开发者（类 Redux / Vuex）\n如果你有几十个状态模块、多人维护、需要强类型约束和统一 DevTools，那 Pinia 是更稳的方案。\n❗但如果你是中小团队、独立开发、组件灵活变更多……\n用组合式 API 代替 Pinia，是一个完全自然的进化。\n你会得到：更简单的状态定义, 更自由的逻辑组合, 更少的心智负担, 更轻的项目依赖（减少打包体积）\nPinia 有它的价值的，但不是每个 Vue 项目都需要它。\nVue 3 最大的价值，就是组合式 API 足够强，已经能当 Store 了。\n所以在未来，我倾向这样的架构：\n轻状态：组合式 + ref() 封装逻辑模块\n重状态（例如缓存 / SSR / 跨页）：再考虑 Pinia or Vuex\n你们怎么看🙂\n📌 你可以继续看我的系列文章\n《用了三年 Vue，我终于理解为什么“组件设计”才是重灾区》\n《我为什么觉得 React 正在逐渐失去吸引力？》\n《为什么越来越多 Vue 项目用起了 UnoCSS？》\n《为什么我放弃使用 Pinia？》\n《为什么我不再相信 Tailwind？三个月重构项目教会我的事》",

    "description": "2025-06-19 Hacker News Top Stories\n  #\n\n\n\n《大脑袋开发者》通过幽默自嘲方式，主张用80/20法则简化代码、避免过早抽象，并提出“中间测试”比单元测试更实用。\n作者意外复活失效的torrent追踪器后发现310万对等体，揭示中心化风险与法律隐患，最终因信用卡支付域名选择关闭服务。\n开源健身平台Workout.cool以MIT许可证复兴废弃项目，支持本地部署，但部分用户报告加载错误，原作者呼吁合作。\nAnthropic建议构建AI代理时优先使用基础LLM API和简单模式，强调理解底层代码并避免在简单场景中过度依赖框架。\nScrappy允许用户通过拖拽对象和少量JavaScript快速制作个人应用，主张回归直接操作而非AI代码生成。\n伊朗指控WhatsApp泄露用户信息并要求删除该软件，但Meta强调端到端加密，专家指出元数据仍存风险。\n纽约市审计长Brad Lander因在移民法庭外陪同被ICE拘留者引发争议，联邦指控缺乏证据，事件被指标题误导。\nRust重写的bzip2库实现压缩解压速度提升5-15%，消除C语言编译复杂性，或成Linux官方实现替代方案。\nMiniMax-M1开放权重模型参数达4560亿，支持100万token上下文，运行需多H200 GPU，量化后成本可降至1万美元内。\n文章类比Google翻译与编程领域，指出LLMs虽能处理代码结构，但难以应对文化语境和抽象隐喻，需经历“AI寒冬”突破局限。\n#\n\n\n  https://grugbrain.dev/\n《Grug Brained Developer》是一本关于软件开发的幽默指南，由自称为“小脑瓜”的开发者 Grug 撰写。Grug 虽然不认为自己很聪明，但多年的编程经验让他学到了一些宝贵的教训。这本书旨在以轻松幽默的方式，为年轻的开发者提供易于消化的知识和建议，同时也帮助 Grug 自己记住那些重要的事项，比如早餐吃了什么或者是否穿了裤子。\n书中首先讨论了软件开发中永恒的敌人——复杂性。Grug 将复杂性比作一个恶魔，它悄悄地潜入代码库，使得原本清晰的工作变得混乱和危险。Grug 认为，对抗复杂性的最好武器是学会说“不”，即拒绝那些不必要的功能和抽象，以保持代码的简洁。虽然这可能不利于职业发展，因为“是”是获得更多奖励和领导地位的魔法词，但 Grug 坚持认为“不”是他的魔法词。\n有时候，妥协是必要的，特别是当没有足够的资源时。在这种情况下，Grug 建议使用“好吧”这个词，并寻找 80/20 的解决方案，即用 20% 的代码实现 80% 的功能。这样的解决方案可能不够完美，但足以满足大部分需求，同时避免复杂性的恶魔。\n书中还讨论了代码的分解（或称为“因素分解”）。Grug 认为，不应该过早地分解应用程序，因为项目初期一切都是抽象的，很难把握。他建议先让系统“成形”，然后再寻找合适的分解点。一个好的分解点应该与系统的其他部分有狭窄的接口，能够隐藏内部的复杂性。\nGrug 还提到了测试的重要性。虽然他尊重测试，但他对一些测试实践持怀疑态度，比如在编写代码之前就要求编写测试。他更喜欢在原型阶段之后编写测试，当代码开始稳定时。Grug 强调，这时候必须非常自律，不能因为“在我的机器上工作”就不写测试，因为这样的代码没有保证在其他机器或未来也能工作。\n最后，Grug 认为理想的测试既不是单元测试也不是端到端测试，而是介于两者之间的测试。单元测试虽然有用，但随着实现的变化容易破裂，使得重构变得困难。端到端测试虽然能展示整个系统的运作，但当它们失败时很难理解原因，有时开发者会选择忽略它们。Grug 建议，测试应该在项目初期帮助启动项目，但不要期望它们能长期提供价值。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44303542\n在小公司和大型科技公司中，很多人仍然使用打印语句进行调试，而不是使用调试器。\n学习使用调试器是一项小超能力，可以更容易地理解系统。\n一些经验丰富的程序员倾向于使用打印语句和自我检查代码，而不是调试器。\n调试器在对问题领域理解不足时最有用，而打印调试在对代码非常了解时更有用。\n游戏开发与 Web 开发在调试上有所不同，游戏开发更依赖于调试器，而 Web 开发由于其分布式特性，更适合使用日志。\n理解两种调试方法，并在适当的情况下大胆使用它们。\n即使在复杂的 AAA 游戏中，如果代码是自己写的，通常不需要使用调试器。\nAAA 游戏不可能由一个人从头开始编写。\n在复杂、长期存在的可变状态、精确的内存管理和视觉渲染领域，调试器可能更有帮助。\n分布式环境也可以使用调试器，尽管需要一些额外的设置。\n#\n\n\n  https://kianbradley.com/2025/06/15/resurrecting-a-dead-tracker.html\nKian Bradley 在他的博客中分享了他复活一个已经死亡的 torrent 追踪器并发现 300 万对等体的经历。他开始时下载 Linux ISO 文件，但速度很慢，于是检查了 qBittorrent 中的追踪器标签页，发现大多数追踪器已经失效。这让他思考，如果接管这些失效的域名，会有多少客户端尝试连接？\n他解释说，追踪器是 BitTorrent 协议的核心组件，它们指向其他对等体以共享 torrent 文件。没有追踪器，就没有人可以共享文件，这代表了

Anthropic 于 2024 年 12 月 19 日发布，讨论了在不同行业中构建大型语言模型（LLM）代理的成功实践。文章指出，成功的实施往往不是依赖复杂的框架或专用库，而是使用简单、可组合的模式。文章分享了与客户合作和自身构建代理的经验，并为开发者提供了构建有效代理的实用建议。\n什么是代理？\n代理可以有多种定义。一些客户将代理视为完全自主的系统，它们可以独立运行较长时间，并使用各种工具完成复杂任务。其他人则用这个术语来描述更规范的实现，这些实现遵循预定义的工作流程。Anthropic 将所有这些变体归类为代理系统，但在工作流和代理之间画了一条重要的架构分界线：工作流是通过预定义的代码路径编排 LLM 和工具的系统，而代理则是 LLM 动态指导自己的流程和工具使用的系统，控制完成任务的方式。\n何时（以及何时不）使用代理\n在构建 LLM 应用程序时，建议找到最简单的解决方案，并只在需要时增加复杂性。这可能意味着根本不构建代理系统。代理系统通常为了更好的任务性能而牺牲延迟和成本，因此需要考虑这种权衡是否合理。当需要更多复杂性时，对于定义明确的任务，工作流提供了可预测性和一致性，而代理在需要灵活性和模型驱动的决策时是更好的选择。\n何时以及如何使用框架\n有许多框架可以使代理系统更容易实现，包括 LangChain 的 LangGraph、Amazon Bedrock 的 AI 代理框架、Rivet（一个拖放式 GUI LLM 工作流构建器）和 Vellum（另一个用于构建和测试复杂工作流的 GUI 工具）。这些框架通过简化调用 LLM、定义和解析工具以及链接调用等标准低级任务来简化入门。然而，它们经常创建额外的抽象层，这可能会掩盖底层的提示和响应，使调试变得更加困难。它们还可能诱使人们在更简单的设置就足够的情况下增加复杂性。建议开发者直接使用 LLM API：许多模式可以用几行代码实现。如果使用框架，请确保理解底层代码。对底层代码的错误假设是客户错误常见的来源。\n构建块、工作流和代理\n文章接下来探讨了在生产中看到的代理系统的常见模式。从基础构建块——增强型 LLM 开始，逐步增加复杂性，从简单的组合工作流到自主代理。\n基础构建块：增强型 LLM\n代理系统的基本构建块是增强了检索、工具和记忆等增强功能的 LLM。当前的模型可以积极使用这些能力——生成自己的搜索查询、选择合适的工具以及确定要保留的信息。建议关注实现的两个关键方面：将这些能力定制到特定用例，并确保它们为 LLM 提供简单、文档丰富的接口。虽然有许多方法可以实现这些增强功能，但一种方法是通过最近发布的 Model Context Protocol，它允许开发者通过简单的客户端实现与不断增长的第三方工具生态系统集成。\n工作流：提示链\n提示链将任务分解为一系列步骤，每个 LLM 调用处理前一个调用的输出。可以在任何中间步骤上添加程序检查（下图中的“门”），以确保过程仍在正确轨道上。提示链工作流适用于任务可以轻松且清晰地分解为固定子任务的情况。主要目标是通过使每个 LLM 调用变得更容易来交换延迟以获得更高的准确性。\n工作流：路由\n路由对输入进行分类并将其引导至专门的后续任务。这种工作流允许分离关注点，并构建更专业的提示。如果没有这种工作流，针对一种类型的输入进行优化可能会损害其他输入的性能。路由工作流适用于复杂任务，其中存在可以单独处理的不同类别，并且分类可以由 LLM 或更传统的分类模型/算法准确处理。\n工作流：并行化\nLLM 有时可以同时在任务上工作，并将它们的输出以程序方式聚合。这种工作流，即并行化，有两种主要变体：分割和投票。分割是将任务分解为独立子任务并行运行。投票是多次运行同一任务以获得多样化的输出。并行化在可以为速度并行化划分的子任务有效，或者当需要多个视角或尝试以获得更高信心结果时有效。\n工作流：指挥者-工作者\n在指挥者-工作者工作流中，一个中心 LLM 动态地分解任务，将它们委托给工作者 LLM，并综合它们的结果。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301809\n文章清晰定义了“AI 代理”的含义，即动态指导自身流程和工具使用的系统。\n区分了“代理”和“工作流”，并描述了一些有用的工作流模式。\n有作者通过视频分享了文章内容，反响良好。\n有人认为不使用框架从头构建系统是个好的教育尝试，但好的框架可以方便地尝试不同的 LLMs。\n有人认为更换 API 并不是瓶颈，而是模型之间的行为问题或能力差异。\n框架通常会增加复杂性、不透明性和 API 不一致性。\n有人认为在获得足够的可观察性、实验性等功能后，是否应该默认使用框架成为一个真正的问题。\n有人建议如果不是完全的初创公司，最好直接使用 API 来启动 V0 产品。\n有人觉得用未类型化的语言构建复杂系统令人费解，尤其是当唯一的 AI 或 ML 是 API 调用时。\n有人强调测试中更换 API 是一个巨大的痛苦，使用一套可以更换密钥和变量的设置可以大大简化这个过程。\n有人推荐使用提供不同 LLMs 抽象的库（而不是框架）。\n框架如果具有可观察性、评估、部署、云安全等结构，也可以帮助准备生产。\n文章对工作流的定义被认为不准确，现代引擎的工作流并不采取预定义的代码路径。\n有人认为工作流和代理之间的区分在于“引导程度”，工作流结构和规则更多，而代理更自由。\n有人通过一个语言标记的工作流示例强调了 LLMs 在没有“脚手架”的情况下不够可靠。\n有人认为现代系统中的工作流通常不可预测，它们经常根据前一个调用（例如 LLM 调用）的响应执行一组工具中的一个。\n#\n\n\n  https://pontus.granstrom.me/scrappy/\n这篇文章由 John Chang 和 Pontus Granström 撰写，讨论了自制软件的概念和潜力。文章介绍了他们共同开发的一个研究原型工具——Scrappy，这是一个用于制作仅供个人及其朋友使用的“简陋”应用程序的工具。他们希望通过分享这个工具和一些用它制作的应用程序示例，来具体化自制软件可能的样子。\nScrappy 是什么？\nScrappy 允许用户创建“Scrapps”，即针对特定需求的应用程序。文章通过几个例子来说明 Scrappy 的应用场景，包括为小学生练习算术、本地活动参与者计数器、会议成本时钟以及每周家务追踪器等。这些应用程序虽然可能不够精致或引人注目，但它们是根据个人喜好制作的，并且能够满足特定的需求。\n制作 Scrappy 应用程序的体验\nScrappy 提供了一个无限的交互式对象画布，其工作流程类似于 Figma、Miro 或 Google Slides。用户可以在画布上拖动对象，如按钮、文本字段和标签，并通过检查器面板修改对象属性。例如，按钮对象有“点击时”属性，其中包含 JavaScript 代码。当按钮被点击时，会运行该代码，比如将文本字段的内容记录到作为日志的标签上。用户可以逐步构建应用程序，调整和重新排列对象，并为它们附加少量代码。\n文章中还提供了视频，展示了作者如何制作一个活动参与者计数器。视频展示了添加数字字段、按钮、场地容量字段以及当人数过多时显示警告的过程。Scrappy 应用程序是多人在线的，应用程序状态被持久化和同步，类似于在线文档如 Google Sheets 或 Figma。此外，Scrappy 应用程序始终处于活动状态，编辑和运行之间没有区别，用户可以在朋友使用时编辑应用程序。用户还可以选择性地分享应用程序的特定部分，例如只分享进出人数的部分。\n为什么制作 Scrappy？\n该项目的驱动力是重新构想软件的创建和使用。作为“小计算”、“休闲编程”和“家常菜软件”运动的一部分，作者希望解放最终用户，让他们能够在不需要成为专业程序员的情况下表达自己。他们希望将世界从大众市场、工业化生产的软件转向更个人化、甚至一次性的工具，这些工具可以为特定的社会环境设计并容易修改和适应。他们受到 Notion、tldraw 和 mmm.page 等工具的简单性的启发，但希望赋予人们更丰富的交互性和编程能力。\nScrappy 的目标用户是谁？\n在原型设计过程中，Scrappy 的理想用户并不明确。随着系统的构建，一些潜在的用户画像逐渐显现出来。这些用户包括希望使用软件改进业务流程的过程优化者、教师和学生，以及像作者这样的专业程序员，他们不喜欢编程，因为编程过程中的复杂性增加了摩擦。\n文章最后提到，尽管他们认识到基于 AI 的系统利用 LLMs 进行代码生成的能力，但他们有意识地选择将设计重点放在直接操作和用户控制上。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44306859\n有人喜欢 Scrappy 的精神，但认为其作为一个托管解决方案，依赖于 SaaS 工具，不适合长期使用。\n有人倾向于使用 HTML/CSS/JS 和 PHP 等基本技术来构建个人项目，因为它们不依赖于浏览器，且维护成本低。\n有人提出 TiddlyWiki 的概念，认为它是一个完整的 Web 应用程序，可以自复制，适合小规模个性化需求。\n有人正在构建一个受 TiddlyWiki 启发的自修改 HTML 运行时环境，允许用户在单个 HTML 文件中构建“HTML 应用程序”。\n有人询问这种技术是否与超媒体方法相一致，并探讨了是否有相关书籍或工具来支持这种技术。\n有人提到 TiddlyWiki 的“写入原地”功能，强调其在家庭维护维基/手册中的终极生存能力。\n有人希望有一个框架，能够像 TiddlyWiki 那样自我复制，但更简单，并且能够更好地集成 Markdown 和 HTML。\n有人对 Hyperclay 的无应用安装需求表示赞赏，认为它结合了 TiddlyWiki 的简单性和共享网络的优势。\n有人对需要运行服务器来共享 TiddlyWiki 表示疑虑，认为这对普通用户来说并不简单。\n#\n\n\n  https://apnews.com/article/iran-whatsapp-meta-israel-d9e6fe43280123c9963802e6f10ac8d1\n伊朗国家电视台于 2025 年 6 月 18 日呼吁民众从智能手机上删除 WhatsApp，声称该应用在未经具体证据的情况下收集用户信息并将其发送给以色列。WhatsApp 对此表示关切，认为这些虚假报道可能成为封锁其服务的借口，特别是在民众最需要其服务的时候。WhatsApp 强调其使用端到端加密技术，确保消息只有发件人和收件人能够读取，而中间的服务提供者无法解读。\nWhatsApp 在声明中表示：“我们不追踪用户的确切位置，不保留每个人的消息记录，也不追踪个人之间发送的消息。我们不会向任何政府提供批量信息。” 不过，康奈尔大学的网络安全专家 Gregory Falco 指出，WhatsApp 的元数据并不加密，这意味着可以获取有关用户如何使用该应用的信息。此外，数据主权也是一个问题，因为 WhatsApp 的数据中心并不一定位于用户所在的国家，这使得数据安全和信任变得更加复杂。\n伊朗在过去几年中曾多次封锁社交媒体平台，但许多人通过代理和虚拟私人网络（VPN）绕过限制。在 2022 年因一名女性在道德警察拘留期间去世而爆发的大规模抗议活动中，伊朗曾封锁 WhatsApp 和 Google Play，但去年底这一禁令已被解除。WhatsApp 曾是伊朗最受欢迎的消息应用之一，除了 Instagram 和 Telegram。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44302752\nMeta 的声明用词巧妙，实际上可能在追踪一般位置、记录群组消息，并在请求时向政府提供特定信息。\n如果 Meta 秘密向某些情报机构提供后门访问权限，就像微软对 PRISM 计划或 AT&T 对 641A 计划那样，可能没有人会发现，因此 Meta 没有实际的不利后果。\nMeta 在其他事情上也撒谎，没有理由现在不撒谎，因为他们被抓到撒谎后似乎并没有受到太大惩罚。\n有人质疑 Meta 是否曾经故意撒谎，并要求提供例子。\n欧洲委员会发现 Facebook 在 2014 年收购 WhatsApp 时提供了“误导性信息”，特别是关于用户数据共享的问题。\n有人提到 Meta“不小心”重置用户隐私设置是一种撒谎行为。\n有人认为企业广告中的“高达 50% 的折扣”是一种技术性的真实说法，但实际上大多数产品只有很小的折扣。\n有人认为最好的律师为这些大公司工作，他们擅长起草条款和条件，使得公司即使有不当行为也不会在法庭上被抓住撒谎。\n有人认为在 GDPR 下非法的 Android 本地主机网络到应用跟踪可能算作 Meta 的撒谎行为。\n有人指出，即使人们发现了 Meta 的不当行为，也没有什么实质性的后果。\n有人强调，即使在发现不当行为后，也没有人真正关心。\n有人认为，尽管媒体被少数人控制，但仍有很多人关心隐私、健康保险、环境等问题。\n#\n\n\n  https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/17/brad-lander-arrest-ice-immigration-court/\n这篇文章报道了纽约市审计长 Brad Lander 在曼哈顿的一个移民法庭外被联邦特工拘留的事件。Brad Lander 同时也是下周二民主党初选中的市长候选人。事件开始于 Lander 在移民法庭的最新访问，他试图陪同一名男子离开法庭。\n\nLander 在被拘留超过四小时后，最终在纽约州州长 Kathy Hochul 的干预下被释放，没有受到任何指控。他在获释后对支持者表示，虽然他知道自己会得到公正的审判和权利保护，但与他一同被拘留的移民 Edgardo 将被关押在 ICE 的拘留设施中，失去了公正审判的权利。\nLander 此前已经第三次观察联邦移民听证会，并陪同移民离开例行的法庭听证。在中午时分，他与 Edgardo 手挽手离开移民法庭，拒绝放手，即使联邦特工试图将他们分开。在混乱的场面中，Lander 反复要求特工出示司法令状，并声称“你们没有权力逮捕美国公民”，随后被戴上手铐。\n联邦特工将他带进电梯，他的一名纽约警察局安全小组成员也陪同在旁。有记者听到一名特工在 Lander 被捕前对另一名特工说：“你想逮捕审计长吗？”\n联邦当局确实想要逮捕他。国土安全部助理秘书 Tricia McLaughlin 在声明中表示，Brad Lander 因攻击执法人员和妨碍联邦官员而被逮捕，并强调“没有人可以凌驾于法律之上，如果你攻击执法人员，你将面临后果”。官方的国土安全部 X 账户在推特上也发表了同样的言论，并指责寻求更高职位的政治人物破坏执法安全以获得病毒式传播的时刻。\n报道中提到，THE CITY 的视频显示 Lander 紧抓着 ICE 逮捕的人，但没有显示他攻击任何人。Lander 的逮捕引起了广泛的愤怒，许多民选官员和市长候选人聚集在 26 联邦广场，要求立即释放他。其中包括共同支持 Lander 竞选市长的议员 Zohran Mamdani。\n州长 Kathy Hochul 在社交媒体上表示：“这是胡说八道”，并在当天下午晚些时候亲自前往 26 联邦广场，拥抱了 Lander 的妻子，然后进入大楼。她告诉记者，她来这里是为了支持 Lander 和所有处于这种情况的人，并表示这是不可容忍的。\n市长 Eric Adams 的发言人 Kayla Mamelak Altus 在 Lander 被捕四小时后发表声明，表示“今天不应该关注 Brad Lander”，而是要确保所有纽约人——无论他们的文件状态如何——都感到足够安全，能够使用公共资源，如拨打 911、送孩子上学、去医院或出庭，而不是躲在阴影中。在此之前，至少有两位 Adams 的政治盟友在网上嘲笑了 Lander，包括前市长幕僚长 Frank Carone，他嘲笑这是一场“奥斯卡奖”表演。\n#\n\n\n

https://trifectatech.org/blog/bzip2-crate-switches-from-c-to-rust/\n这篇文章由 Folkert de Vries 在 2025 年 6 月 17 日发表，主题是关于 bzip2 数据压缩算法的一个重大更新。文章宣布了 bzip2 版本 0.6.0 的发布，这个版本默认使用了 Rust 实现的 bzip2 算法，即 libbz2-rs-sys。这个更新使得 bzip2 crate（Rust 的包管理器中的一个包）在性能上有所提升，并且更容易进行跨平台编译。\n文章首先提出了一个问题：为什么还要在今天关注这个 90 年代的算法，尽管它现在使用得很少？作者解释说，许多协议和库仍然需要支持 bzip2 以符合它们的规范，因此许多项目在其依赖树的深层仍然依赖于 bzip2。作者利用在 zlib-rs 项目中的经验，对 bzip2 的实现进行了现代化改造。\n文章接着详细介绍了 Rust 实现相对于 C 实现的性能改进。在压缩方面，Rust 实现通常比 C 实现更快，尽管在某些情况下两者性能相当。对于 bzip2，压缩级别指示使用的内存量，但对性能影响不大。文章提供了一些具体的性能对比数据，显示了在不同压缩级别和文件类型下，Rust 实现在压缩和解压缩方面的性能提升。\n文章还提到了跨平台编译的优势。使用 C 依赖的 Rust 项目通常可以开箱即用地进行跨平台编译，但如果出现问题，错误可能难以调试。通过移除 C 依赖并使用 Rust 代码，编译 C 的复杂性消失了，使得跨平台编译变得简单，尤其是在编译到 WebAssembly、Windows 或 Android 时。\n此外，文章提到了默认情况下 libbz2-rs-sys 不导出符号，这意味着它不会与其他依赖项冲突。如果 Rust 项目需要导出符号，可以通过一个特性标志来启用。\n文章还提到了使用 MIRI 运行测试的好处，MIRI 是一个 Rust 的实验性运行时，可以运行包含 unsafe 代码的程序。这不仅对 bzip2 实现本身有益，也使得使用 bzip2 的更高级别的库或应用程序能够运行在 MIRI 上。\n最后，文章提到了审计结果，审计发现了一个逻辑错误（一个偏移量错误），并修复了 fuzzer 的一些限制。除此之外，没有发现重大问题。\n文章以对参与项目的个人和组织的感谢结束，包括 Alex Crichton、Radically Open Security 和 NLnet Foundation。\n#\n\n\n  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44303361\nTrifecta Tech 的 bzip2 实现有可能取代 Linux 发行版中使用的官方实现。\n官方 bzip2 实现自 2019 年以来没有更新，可能意味着项目已经完成。\n10-15% 的压缩速度提升和 5-10% 的解压缩速度提升是一个吸引人的新特性。\n代码优化提高速度的同时可能会牺牲代码可读性。\n将现有代码库翻译成 Rust 可能会使事情变得更复杂。\nUbuntu 已经开始使用 Rust 编写的

https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1\nMiniMax-M1 是一个全球首个开放权重、大规模混合注意力推理模型。该模型采用混合专家（MoE）架构和闪电注意力机制，基于之前的 MiniMax-Text-01 模型开发，包含 4560 亿参数，每个 token 激活 459 亿参数。与 MiniMax-Text-01 一致，M1 模型原生支持 100 万个 token 的上下文长度，是 DeepSeek R1 的 8 倍。MiniMax-M1 的闪电注意力机制使得测试时计算效率得到提升，例如在生成 100K 个 token 时，M1 消耗的 FLOPs 仅为 DeepSeek R1 的 25%。这些特性使得 M1 特别适合处理需要长时间输入和深入思考的复杂任务。\nMiniMax-M1 通过大规模强化学习（RL）训练，涉及从传统数学推理到基于沙盒的真实世界软件工程环境的多样化问题。开发了一个高效的 RL 扩展框架，突出了两个视角：（1）提出了 CISPO 算法，该算法剪裁重要性采样权重而非 token 更新，表现优于其他竞争 RL 变体；（2）混合注意力设计自然提高了 RL 的效率，解决了在混合架构下扩展 RL 时的独特挑战。训练了两个版本的 MiniMax-M1 模型，分别具有 40K 和 80K 的思考预算。在标准基准测试中，这些模型在复杂软件工程、工具使用和长上下文任务上超越了其他强大的开放权重模型，如原始的 DeepSeek-R1 和 Qwen3-235B。凭借测试时计算的高效扩展，MiniMax-M1 为下一代语言模型代理提供了强大的基础，以推理和应对现实世界的挑战。\n在核心基准测试中，MiniMax-M1 的性能如下：\n数学：在 AIME 2024、AIME 2025 和 MATH-500 等任务中，MiniMax-M1-80K 和 MiniMax-M1-40K 的表现均优于 Qwen3-235B-A22B 和 DeepSeek-R1-0528。\n通用编码：在 LiveCodeBench 和 FullStackBench 任务中，MiniMax-M1 的表现同样优于其他模型。\n推理与知识：在 GPQA Diamond、HLE（无工具）和 ZebraLogic 等任务中，MiniMax-M1 的成绩领先。\n软件工程：在 SWE-bench Verified 任务中，MiniMax-M1 的得分高于其他模型。\n长上下文：在 OpenAI-MRCR（128k 和 1M）和 LongBench-v2 任务中，MiniMax-M1 的表现优异。\n代理工具使用：在 TAU-bench（航空公司和零售）任务中，MiniMax-M1 的得分也超过了其他模型。\n事实性：在 SimpleQA 任务中，MiniMax-M1 的得分较低。\n通用助手：在 MultiChallenge 任务中，MiniMax-M1 的表现与其他模型相当。\n所有模型均在温度为 1.0、top_p 为 0.95 的条件下进行评估。SWE-bench

    "description": "The Batch AI News and Insights: One of the most effective things the U.S. or any other nation can do to ensure its competitiveness in AI is to welcome high-skilled immigration and international students who have the potential to become high-skilled.\n   \nLoading the Elevenlabs Text to Speech AudioNative Player...\nDear friends,\nOne of the most effective things the U.S. or any other nation can do to ensure its competitiveness in AI is to welcome high-skilled immigration and international students who have the potential to become high-skilled. For centuries, the U.S. has welcomed immigrants, and this helped make it a worldwide leader in technology. Letting immigrants and native-born Americans collaborate makes everyone better off. Reversing this stance would have a huge negative impact on U.S. technology development.\nI was born in the UK and came to the U.S. on an F-1 student visa as a relatively unskilled and clueless teenager to attend college. Fortunately I gained skills and became less clueless over time. After completing my graduate studies, I started working at Stanford under the OPT (Optional Practical Training) program, and later an H-1B visa, and ended up staying here. Many other immigrants have followed similar paths to contribute to the U.S.\nI am very concerned that making visas harder to obtain for students and high-skilled workers, such as the pause in new visa interviews that started last month and a newly chaotic process of visa cancellations, will hurt our ability to attract great students and workers. In addition, many international students without substantial means count on being able to work under OPT to pay off the high cost of a U.S. college degree. Gutting the OPT program, as has been proposed, would both hurt many international students’ ability to study here and deprive U.S. businesses of great talent. (This won’t stop students from wealthy families. But the U.S. should try to attract the best talent without regard to wealth.)\nFailure to attract promising students and high-skilled workers would have a huge negative impact on American competitiveness in AI. Indeed, a recent report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence exhorts the government to “strengthen AI talent through immigration.”\nIf talented people do not come to the U.S., will they have an equal impact on global AI development just working somewhere else? Unfortunately, the net impact will be negative. The U.S. has a number of tech hubs including Austin, Boston/Cambridge, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Seattle, and Silicon Valley, and these hubs concentrate talent and foster innovation. (This is why cities, where people can more easily find each other and collaborate, promote innovation.) Making it harder for AI talent to find each other and collaborate will slow down innovation, and it will take time for new hubs to become as advanced.\n\nNonetheless, other nations are working hard to attract immigrants who can drive innovation — a good move for them! Many have thoughtful programs to attract AI and other talent. There are the UK’s Global Talent Visa, France’s French Tech Visa, Australia’s Global Talent Visa, UAE’s Golden Visa, Taiwan’s Employment Gold Card, China’s Thousand Talents Plan, and many more. The U.S. is fortunate that many people already want to come here to study and work. Squandering that advantage would be a huge unforced error.\nBeyond the matter of national competitiveness, there is the even more important ethical matter of making sure people are treated decently. I have spoken with international students who are terrified that their visas may be canceled arbitrarily. One recently agonized about whether to attend an international conference to present a research paper, because they were worried about being unable to return. In the end, with great sadness, they cancelled their trip. I also spoke with a highly skilled technologist who is in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. Their company shut down, leading them — after over a decade in this country, and with few ties to their nation of origin — scrambling to find alternative employment that would enable them to stay.\nThese stories, and many far worse, are heartbreaking. While I do what I can to help individuals I know personally, it is tragic that we are creating such an uncertain environment for immigrants, that many people who have extraordinary skills and talents will no longer want to come here.\nTo every immigrant or migrant in the U.S. who is concerned about the current national environment: I see you and empathize with your worries. As an immigrant myself, I will be fighting to protect everyone’s dignity and right to due process, and to encourage legal immigration, which makes both the U.S. and individuals much better off.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\n\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\n\nLearn to build with Meta’s Llama 4 models in this new short course! Work with the official Llama API, explore multimodal reasoning with image grounding, reason over long-context, and use tools for prompt optimization and synthetic data generation. Join in for free\nNews\n\nApple Sharpens Its GenAI Profile\nApple revamped two vision-language models in a bid to catch up with fast-moving competitors.\nWhat’s new: Apple updated the Apple Foundation Models (AFM) family, including smaller on-device and larger server-hosted versions, to improve their capabilities, speed, and efficiency. It also released the Foundation Models framework, an API that enables developers to call the on-device model on Apple devices that have Apple Intelligence enabled.\n\nInput/output: Text, images in (up to 65,000 tokens), text out\nArchitecture: AFM-on-device: 3 billion-parameter transformer, 300-million parameter vision transformer. AFM-server: custom mixture-of-experts transformer (parameter count undisclosed), 1 billion-parameter vision transformer.\nPerformance: Strong in non-U.S. English, image understanding\nAvailability: AFM-on-device for developers to use via Foundations Models framework, AFM-server not available for public use\nFeatures: Tool use, 15 languages, vision\nUndisclosed: Output token limit, AFM-server parameter count, details of training datasets, vision adapter architecture, evaluation protocol\n\nHow it works: Introduced last year, AFM models use a vision encoder to produce an image embedding, which a vision adapter modifies for the LLM. The LLM takes the modified image embedding and text prompt and generates a response. The team trained the systems to predict the next token, align embeddings produced by the vision encoder and LLM, and align responses with human feedback. They trained the models on text and image-text data from publicly available datasets, data scraped from the web, and data licensed from publishers.\n\nQuantization: The team used quantization aware training (simulating quantization during training to improve performance of the quantized model at inference) to compress AFM-on-device to 2 bits per weight (except for the embedding layer, which was compressed to 4 bits per weight). They used Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression, a method initially designed for graphics pipelines, to compress the AFM-server model to an average of 3.56 bits per weight (except for the embedding layer, which is compressed to 4 bits per weight).\nLoRA adapters: They trained LoRA adapters to recover performance loss due to compression, which adapted the model to specific tasks including summarization, proofreading, replying to  email, and answering questions.\nMoE architecture: While AFM-on-device uses a transformer architecture, AFM-server uses a custom mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. A typical MoE can be viewed as splitting a portion of its fully connected layers into a number of parallel fully connected layers, of which it uses only a portion at inference. In comparison, the AFM-server’s MoE first splits the model into groups of layers, then it splits each group into parallel blocks. Each block is a separate multi-layer transformer outfitted with MoE layers (processed on a small number of hardware devices). While a typical MoE combines results across all devices at every mixture-of-experts layer, Apple’s architecture combines them only at the end of each block, which saves communication overhead during processing.\n\nPerformance: In human evaluations, the AFM models achieved mixed performance compared to selected models of similar or greater size. The tests included language tasks in U.S. English, non-U.S. English (including Canada and UK), and a basket of European and Asian languages. \n\nAFM-on-device: The on-device model performed better than the competitors at language tasks in non-U.S. English and image understanding. For instance, answering questions about images, AFM-on-device bested Qwen2.5-VL-3B more than 50 percent of the time and was judged worse 27 percent of the time.\nAFM-server: The server model’s performance was not decisively better than that of the competitors. For instance, AFM-server outperformed Qwen3-23B 25.8 percent of the time but was judged worse 23.7 percent of the time. It underperformed GPT-4o in all tests reported.\n\nBehind the news: Apple dominated social media last week with a controversial paper that purported to show that 5 state-of-the-art reasoning models couldn’t solve puzzles beyond a certain level of complexity.\n\nThe researchers prompted the models with four puzzles that allowed them to control complexity, including swapping the positions of red and blue checkers on a one-dimensional checkers board, Tower of Hanoi, River Crossing, and Blocks World. For all the puzzles and models, they found, the models’ performance fell to zero when the puzzles reached a certain degree of complexity (for example, a certain number of checkers to swap).\nA rebuttal paper quickly appeared, penned by Open Philanthropy senior program associate Alex Lawsen with help from Claude 4 Opus. Lawsen contended that Apple’s conclusions were unfounded because its tests included unsolvable puzzles, didn’t account for token output limits, and posed unrealistic criteria for judging outputs. However, he later posted a blog, “When Your Joke Paper Goes Viral,” in which he explained that he intended his paper as “obvious satire” of authors who use LLMs to write scientific papers, and that he hadn’t checked Claude 4 Opus’ output. He updated his paper to correct errors in the original version but maintained his fundamental critique.\n\nWhy it matters: Apple has been viewed as falling behind in AI. A promised upgrade of Siri, Apple’s AI assistant, is delayed indefinitely, and the lack of advanced AI features in new iPhones has led to a class-action lawsuit. Meanwhile, Google and its Android smartphone platform are racing ahead. The new models, especially the Foundation Models framework, look like a bid for a reset.\nWe’re thinking: Apple may be behind in AI, but its control over iOS is a huge advantage. If the operating system ships with a certain model and loads it into the limited memory by default, developers have a far greater incentive to use that model than an alternative. Limited memory on phones and the large size of good models make it impractical for many app developers to bundle models with their software, so if a model is favored by Apple (or Android), it’s likely to gain significant adoption for on-device uses.\n\nHollywood Joins AI Copyright Fight\nHollywood studios joined the record companies, publishers, and artists in the fight against companies that have trained AI models on their copyrighted works.\nWhat’s new: Disney and Universal sued Midjourney, accusing the image-generation startup of training its models on “countless” unauthorized copies of their copyrighted works and distributing images that depict characters the plaintiffs created.\nHow it works: Disney and Universal asked the court to order Midjourney to cease its alleged unauthorized distribution of their intellectual property. Further, they want Midjourney, which took in revenue of $300 million in 2024, to pay unspecified damages based on the claim that copyright law entitles them to $150,000 per infringed image. The studios accuse Midjourney of both direct infringement (that is, directly violating their copyrights by copying, displaying, or distributing their work without permission) and secondary infringement (enabling or encouraging direct infringement by others).\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Midjourney reproduces copyrighted and derivative works, including the images of movie and television characters from Star Wars, Toy Story, Cars, Ironman, and The Simpsons.\nMidjourney generates such images even if users don’t ask for them explicitly. For instance, an image allegedly generated in response to the prompt, “Superhero fight scene,” includes Disney’s Spider-Man character.\nMidjourney is aware of the infringement, the studios claim, pointing out that Midjourney’s website includes infringing images in sections curated by the company.\nMidjourney could use software that would prevent its system from generating and distributing copyrighted material, the lawsuit says, citing other software products that identify copyrighted works automatically.\nThe filing alleges that Disney and Universal sent cease-and-desist letters to Midjourney, but the AI company didn’t stop producing and distributing images that infringe their copyrights.\n\nBehind the news: Copyright law is ambiguous on whether training AI systems on copyrighted works requires permission from the copyright holders, and several cases are winding their way through U.S. courts to answer this question. Starting in 2023, artists, authors, and publishers initiated legal actions against Alphabet, Meta, and OpenAI. Last year, some of the largest companies in the recording industry sued the AI music startups Suno and Udio. In February, a Delaware federal court issued the first major decision in this area, when a U.S. Circuit judge ruled that an AI-powered legal research service could not claim that training its models on writings produced by Thomson Reuters was a fair use because the resulting products competed with Thomson Reuters’ own products.\nWhy it matters: AI systems require enormous amounts of data. Historically, developers have felt free to use whatever copyrighted works they could find, typically online. As AI systems show greater potential to erode the market for human-made creative works — and to reproduce such works and create new works derived from them — owners of copyrighted material are looking for compensation as well as protection against this new form of competition. A single lawsuit won’t settle the issue, but this case, brought by two of the most powerful entertainment companies in the world, could set a precedent that strongly influences future lawsuits, the behavior of AI companies, and future legislation to update copyright for the AI era.\nWe’re thinking: Film studios and music labels once considered YouTube a copyright violator. Viacom, the entertainment company behind MTV and The Jersey Shore, once sued YouTube for copyright infringement. YouTube prevailed in two proceedings before the parties settled out of court, and YouTube subsequently improved its ability to detect and remove copyrighted works. Today, movie and recording companies rely on the enormously popular web video service to promote their wares. Given that history, Hollywood might consider partnering with AI companies instead of suing them. The pie would be bigger if Hollywood and AI companies worked together, although how to divide it would need to be worked out.\n\nMore Reasoning for Harder Problems\nOpenAI launched o3-pro, a more capable version of its most advanced reasoning vision-language model.\nWhat’s new: o3-pro is designed to respond to difficult challenges involving science, mathematics, and coding. But its reasoning firepower dramatically slows response times.\n\nInput/output: Text and images in (up to 200,000 tokens), text out (up to 100,000 tokens, 20.7 tokens per second, 129.2 seconds to first token)\nKnowledge cutoff: June 1, 2024\nFeatures: Function calling including web search, structured output\nAvailability/price: Available to ChatGPT Pro and Team users via OpenAI API, soon to Enterprise and Edu users, for $20/$80 per 1 million tokens of input/output\nUndisclosed: Details about architecture, training data, and training methods\n\nPerformance: o3-pro outperformed OpenAI’s own o3 (set to medium effort) and o1-pro in tests performed by OpenAI.\n\nSolving AIME 2024’s advanced high-school math competition problems on the first try, o3-pro (93 percent) bested o3 (90 percent) and o1-pro (86 percent).\nAnswering GPQA Diamond’s graduate-level science questions on the first try, o3-pro (85 percent) outperformed o3 (81 percent) and o1-pro (79 percent).\nCompleting Codeforces competition-coding problems in one pass, o3-pro (2748 CodeElo) surpassed o3 (2517 CodeElo) and o1-pro (1707 CodeElo).\nIn qualitative tests, human reviewers consistently preferred o3-pro over o3 for queries related to scientific analysis (64.9 percent), personal writing (66.7 percent), computer programming (62.7 percent), and data analysis (64.3 percent).\n\nWhat they’re saying: Reviews of o3-pro so far generally are positive, but the model has been criticized for the time it takes to respond. Box CEO Aaron Levie commented that o3-pro is “crazy good at math and logic.” However, entrepreneur Yuchen Jin noted that it’s the “slowest and most overthinking model.”\nBehind the news: OpenAI rolled out o3-pro with a lower price, $20/$80 per 1 million input/output tokens, than o1-pro (which was priced at $150/$600 per 1 million input/output tokens but was deprecated in favor of the new model). Simultaneously it cut the price of o3 by 80 percent to $2/$8 per 1 million input/output tokens. These moves continue the plummeting price of inference over the past year. DeepSeek-R1 offers performance that approaches that of top models for $0.55/$2.19 per 1 million input/output tokens.\nWhy it matters: OpenAI is pushing the limits of current approaches to reasoning, and the results are promising if incremental. o3-pro’s extensive reasoning may appeal to developers who are working on the multi-step scientific problems. For many uses, though, the high price and slow speed may be a dealbreaker.\nWe’re thinking: Letting developers choose between o3 and o3-pro lets them calibrate their computational budget to the difficulty of the task at hand. What if we want to do the same with a trained, open-weights, large language model? Forcing an LLM to generate “Wait” in its output causes it to keep thinking, and can improve its output significantly.\n\nLLM Rights Historical Wrongs\nIn Northern California, old property deeds may still include racial clauses: language, made illegal decades ago, that was designed to ban people of color from owning or living in certain homes. The state of California now requires counties to find and remove them, but manually combing through millions of documents would take years. Researchers used AI to find them automatically.\nWhat’s new: Faiz Surani, Mirac Suzgun, and colleagues at Stanford University and Princeton University fine-tuned a large language model to find racial clauses in deeds for property in the California county of Santa Clara.\nKey insight: Manual and keyword searches may fail to catch racial clauses if they’re obscured by subtle wording or errors in optical character recognition (OCR). But a fine-tuned large language model can understand context, identify relevant phrases, and avoid potential false alarms like the surnames Black or White. Lawyers can confirm the model’s findings.\nHow it works: The authors used an OCR system to extract text from 5.2 million pages of Santa Clara property deeds filed between 1850 and 1980. They drew examples from that corpus to form training and validation datasets and then processed the rest to find deeds that contained racial clauses.\n\nTo curate examples for training and validation, the authors started by sampling 20,000 pages at random. Since deeds have significant variation in format and quality, they added 10,000 deeds from other U.S. counties.\nThey filtered the combined examples using keywords that may indicate racial clauses, such as “Negro,” “Mongolian,” or “No person of,” yielding 3,801 pages.\nThey manually labeled the spans that included such language, which appeared on roughly 80 percent of those pages.\nThey fine-tuned Mistral-7B via LoRA on the labeled examples to learn to detect and reproduce discriminatory text.\n\nResults: The authors fed the remaining roughly 5.2 million unlabeled pages to the fine-tuned model. When the model identified a deed that contained a racial clause, county staff confirmed the finding and redacted the clause.\n\nThe authors found 24,500 Santa Clara lots covered by racial clauses — about one in four homes in the county in 1950.\nIt also revealed that 10 developers, out of what the authors estimate were hundreds, were responsible for one-third of the racial clauses, demonstrating that only a small number of actors shaped decades of segregation.\nThe fine-tuned model reviewed all pages in 6 days, which would cost an estimated $258 based on current prices for cloud access to GPUs. In contrast, few-shot prompting GPT-3.5 Turbo would have been faster (3.6 days) but less accurate and over 50 times more expensive ($13,634). Working manually, a single county staff member would have needed nearly 10 years and $1.4 million.\n\nWhy it matters: Large language models can interpret historical documents to reveal the nature and scope of actions in the past that otherwise would remain obscure — in this case, housing discrimination. By flagging discriminatory language, this work enables historians to identify areas affected by racial clauses and trace their broader social and economic effects. The team open-sourced the model, streamlining the process for other United States counties.\nWe’re thinking: While AI is making history, it’s also illuminating it!",

    "title": "BigQuery under the hood: Enhanced vectorization in the advanced runtime",
    "url": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/understanding-bigquery-enhanced-vectorization/",
    "description": "Under the hood, there’s a lot of technology and expertise that goes into delivering the performance you get from BigQuery, Google Cloud's data to AI platform. Separating storage and compute provides unique resource allocation flexibility and enables petabyte-scale analysis, while features like compressed storage, compute autoscaling, and flexible pricing contribute to its efficiency. Then there’s the infrastructure — technologies like Borg, Colossus, Jupiter, and Dremel, as we discussed in a previous post.\nBigQuery is continually pushing the limits of query price/performance. Google infrastructure innovations such as L4 in Colossus, userspace host networking, optimized BigQuery storage formats, and a cutting-edge data center network have allowed us to do a complete modernization of BigQuery's core data warehousing technology. We do this while adhering to core principles of self-tuning and zero user intervention, to guarantee the best possible price/performance for all queries. Collectively, we group these improvements into BigQuery's advanced runtime. In this blog post, we introduce you to one of these improvements, enhanced vectorization, now in preview. Then, stay tuned for future blog posts where we’ll go deep on other technologies and techniques in the advanced runtime family.\nEnhanced vectorization: next-level query execution\nBefore diving into enhanced vectorization, let's talk about vectorized query execution. In vectorized query execution, columnar data is processed in blocks the size of the CPU cache using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, which is now the de-facto industry standard for efficient query processing. BigQuery's enhanced vectorization expands on vectorized query execution by applying it to key aspects of query processing, such as filter evaluation in BigQuery storage, support for parallel execution of query algorithms, and through specialized data encodings and optimization techniques. Let's take a closer look.\n\n\n    aside_block\n    <ListValue: [StructValue([('title', '$300 in free credit to try Google Cloud data analytics'), ('body', <wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3e39bf370640>), ('btn_text', 'Start building for free'), ('href', 'http://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/bigquery/'), ('image', None)])]>\n\nData encodings\nModern columnar storage formats use space-efficient data encodings such as dictionary and run-length encodings. For instance, if a column has a million rows but only 10 unique values, dictionary encoding stores those 10 values once and assigns a smaller integer ID to each row rather than repeating the full value. Enhanced vectorization can directly process this encoded data, eliminating redundant computations and significantly boosting query performance. The smaller memory footprint of this encoded data also improves cache locality, creating more opportunities for vectorization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nFigure 1: Dictionary and run-length encodings\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nFor example, as figure 1 demonstrates, “Sedan”, “Wagon” and “SUV” string values are encoded in the dictionary, replacing the repeated string literals with integers that represent indices in the dictionary built from those string values. Subsequently, the repeated integer values can be further represented with run-length encoding. Both types of encodings can offer substantial space and processing savings.\nExpression folding and common subexpression elimination\nEnhanced vectorization integrates native support for dictionary and run-length encoded data directly into its algorithms. This, combined with optimization techniques such as expression folding, folding propagation, and common subexpression elimination, allows it to intelligently reshape query execution plans. The result can be a significant reduction, or indeed complete removal, of unnecessary data processing. \nConsider a scenario where REGEXP_CONTAINS(id, '[0-9]{2}$') AS shard receives dictionary-encoded input. The REGEXP_CONTAINS calculation is performed only once for each unique dictionary value, and the resulting expression is also dictionary-encoded, reducing the number of evaluations significantly and leading to performance improvements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nFigure 2: Dictionary folding\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nHere, the calculation is applied to the input dictionary-encoded data directly, producing output of dictionary-encoded data and skipping the dictionary expansion.\nWith enhanced vectorization, we take expression folding optimization even further by, in some cases, converting an expression into a constant. Consider this query:\n\n\n    code_block\n    <ListValue: [StructValue([('code', \"SELECT SUM(number) FROM table\\r\\nWHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(id, '^.*[0-9]{2}');\"), ('language', 'lang-sql'), ('caption', <wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3e39c0ad6910>)])]>\n\nIf the id in the Capacitor file for this table is dictionary-encoded, the system's expression folding will evaluate all dictionary values, and, because none of its values contain two digits, determine that the REGEXP_CONTAINS condition is always false, and replace the WHERE clause with a constant false. As a result, BigQuery completely skips scanning the Capacitor file for this table, significantly boosting performance. Of course, these optimizations are applicable across a broad range of scenarios and not just to the query used in this example.\nData-encoding-enabled optimizations\nOur state-of-the art join algorithm tries to preserve dictionary and run-length-encoded data wherever possible and makes runtime decisions taking data encoding into account. For example, if the probe side in the join key is dictionary-encoded, we can use that knowledge to avoid repeated hash-table lookups. Also, during aggregation, we can skip building a hashmap if data is already dictionary-encoded and its cardinality is known.\nParallelizable join and aggregation algorithms\nEnhanced vectorization harnesses sophisticated parallelizable algorithms for efficient joins and aggregations. When parallel execution is enabled in a Dremel leaf node for certain query-execution modes, the join algorithm can build and probe the right-hand side hash table in parallel using multiple threads. Similarly, aggregation algorithms can perform both local and global aggregations across multiple threads simultaneously. This parallel execution of join and aggregation algorithms leads to a substantial acceleration of query execution.\nTighter integration with Capacitor\nWe re-engineered Capacitor for the enhanced vectorization runtime, making it smarter and more efficient. This updated version now natively supports semi-structured and JSON data, using sophisticated operators to rebuild JSON data efficiently. Capacitor enables enhanced vectorization runtime to directly access dictionary and run-length-encoded data and apply various optimizations based on data. It intelligently applies folding to a constant optimization when an entire column has the same value. And it can prune expressions in functions expecting NULL, such as IF_NULL and COALESCE, when a column is confirmed to be NULL-free.\nFilter pushdown in Capacitor\nCapacitor leverages the same vectorized engine as enhanced vectorization to efficiently push down filters and computations. This allows for tailored optimizations based on specific file characteristics and the expressions used. When combined with dictionary and run-length-encoded data, this approach delivers exceptionally fast and efficient data scans, enabling further optimizations like expression folding.\nEnhanced vectorization in action\nLet's illustrate the power of these techniques with a concrete example. Enhanced vectorization accelerated one query by 21 times, slashing execution time from over one minute (61 seconds) down to 2.9 seconds.\nThe query that achieved this dramatic speedup was:\n\n\n    code_block\n    <ListValue: [StructValue([('code', 'SELECT\\r\\n  ANY_VALUE(id) AS id,\\r\\n  hash_id\\r\\nFROM (\\r\\n  SELECT\\r\\n    CAST(source_id AS STRING) AS id,\\r\\n    TO_HEX(SHA1(CAST(source_id AS STRING))) AS hash_id\\r\\n  FROM `source_data`)\\r\\nWHERE\\r\\n  hash_id IS NOT NULL\\r\\nGROUP BY\\r\\n  hash_id'), ('language', 'lang-sql'), ('caption', <wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3e39bf370130>)])]>\n\nThis query ran against a table with over 13 billion logical rows spread across 167 partitions, stored in Capacitor columnar storage format and optimized with dictionary and run-length-encoded data.\nWithout enhanced vectorization\nExecuting this query with a regular query engine would involve several steps:\nReading all data for each partition, fully expanding the dictionary and run-length-encoded columnar data.\nComputing CAST(source_id AS STRING) and TO_HEX(SHA1(CAST(source_id AS STRING))) for every single columnar data value.\nBuilding a hashmap from all the non-NULL hash_id values.\nWith enhanced vectorization\nWhen enhanced vectorization processed the same query over the same dataset, it automatically applied these crucial optimizations:\nIt directly scanned the columnar data in the Capacitor file while preserving its dictionary-encoded data.\nIt detected and eliminated duplicate computations for CAST(source_id AS STRING) by identifying them as common subexpressions.\nIt folded the TO_HEX(SHA1(CAST(source_id AS STRING))) computation, propagating the resulting dictionary-encoded data directly to the aggregation step.\nThe aggregation step recognized the data was already dictionary-encoded, allowing it to completely skip building a hashmap for aggregation.\nThis example of 21-times query speedup vividly demonstrates how tight integration between enhanced vectorization runtime and Capacitor and various optimization techniques can lead to substantial query performance improvements.\nWhat’s next\nBigQuery's enhanced vectorization significantly improves query price/performance. Internally, we've seen a substantial reduction in query latency with comparable or even lower slot utilization with enhanced vectorization runtime, though individual query results can differ. This performance gain comes from innovations in both enhanced vectorization and BigQuery's storage formats. \nWe're dedicated to continuously improving both, applying even more advanced optimizations alongside Google's infrastructure advancements in storage, compute, and networking to further boost query efficiency and expand the range of queries that the advanced runtime can handle. Over the coming months, BigQuery’s advanced runtime’s enhanced vectorization will be enabled for all customers by default, but you can enable it earlier for your project today. Next up: We’ll offer BigQuery enhanced vectorization for Parquet files and Iceberg tables!",

Here's how to maximize native protection:\n1. Versioning and retention: first lines of defense\nEnable Object Versioning in Cloud Storage to retain multiple object versions, making it easier to recover from accidental deletions. Pair this with Retention Policies to enforce minimum storage lifetimes for regulatory or critical datasets.\nTip: Use Bucket Lock for write-once-read-many (WORM) protection in the areas where compliance matters most.\n2. Monitor for gaps in coverage\nUse native services like Cloud SQL backups, GKE snapshots, and Persistent Disk images, but be mindful that backup responsibilities can fall to different teams. Without centralized visibility, coverage becomes inconsistent.\nTip: Use Cloud Asset Inventory or scheduled BigQuery queries to audit coverage.\n3. Design for granular recovery\nPlan for partial restores since not everything needs a full rollback. Whether it's a single BigQuery table or a specific Cloud Storage object, restoring only what you need saves time and cost.\nTip: Use Object Lifecycle Management to automatically transition older or less critical Cloud Storage objects to colder storage classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n      \n        \n\n        \nGoogle Cloud New Way to Cloud video interview with Eon CTO Ron Kimchi\n        \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \nWatch out New Way to Cloud interview with Eon CTO and co-founder Ron Kimchi.\nAutomating the complexity away\nManaging cloud backup at scale is hard to do manually. From onboarding new workloads to applying consistent policies, human-led approaches don’t scale well.\nThat’s why more teams are exploring autonomous Cloud Backup Posture Management (CBPM) solutions, like Eon, that detect new assets in real time, apply smart backup rules automatically, and enforce consistent protection across environments.\nWith Eon, you don’t have to tag resources or write custom scripts. Our platform classifies and protects your Google Cloud assets out of the box—whether you're working with GKE, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, or another solution.\nFrom backups to business insights\nTraditionally, backup data was siloed, underused, and only meant to be retrieved in emergencies. But, increasingly, teams are unlocking that data to:\nRun analysis directly on backups using BigQuery and Dataproc,\nFeed training and monitoring pipelines via Vertex AI,\nDeliver audit-ready dashboards with Looker, powered by backup snapshots.\nWith Eon, this is built-in. We transform backups into zero-ETL data lakes that reduce pipeline costs and provide immediate access to structured data with no reprocessing required.\nWhat a “mature” backup posture looks like\nThe end goal for many cloud-native teams is not just to “have backups.” It’s to develop a resilient, intelligent backup strategy that adapts to scale and risk.\nHere’s what that looks like:\nAutomated discovery of new resources\nPolicy-driven protection tailored to data type and criticality\nImmutable backups with time-locked retention\nSearch-first recovery instead of full snapshot restores\nCost-aware tiering and storage deduplication\nEon helps Google Cloud users reach this level of maturity faster without the burden of custom tooling or constant policy updates.\nReady to simplify backup?\nIf your team spends hours managing scripts, storage tiers, or backup tags across cloud environments, it may be time to rethink your approach.\nEon was built to make cloud backup resilient, autonomous, and actually useful. From ransomware protection to instant, object-level recovery—and now, zero-ETL access to analytics—we’re here to help you unlock the full potential of your backup data.\nBook a demo to see how Eon can modernize your Google Cloud data protection strategy.\nTo discover how Google Cloud can support your startup, visit our program page.

    "url": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/looker-gartner-analytics-and-business-intelligence-platforms-mq/",
    "description": "We are pleased to share that Gartner® has named Google a Leader in the 2025 Magic Quadrant™ for Analytics and Business Intelligence, for the second consecutive year. We believe this validates our strategy of delivering a comprehensive BI platform for self-service and governed environments that’s accessible to entire organizations through natural language, and backed by trusted data enabled by a semantic modeling layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nDownload the complimentary 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms.\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nGenerative AI has redefined what a business intelligence platform can offer. In the past year, we introduced Conversational Analytics, a new way for people in all parts of your organization to talk with their data and get answers, using simple, natural language, while also delivering many AI-powered capabilities to the Looker platform, including slide generation, formula creation and more. We also set the stage for AI agents grounded in truth with Looker’s trusted metrics, expanded our semantic layer to new third-party providers, introduced Looker reports for Google-easy dashboarding, and debuted continuous integration to help developers build and test faster.\nThe goal: infusing trusted data into a company’s every workflow and decision.\nThe generative AI revolution in BI\nThe deep integration of Google's foundational Gemini models into the Looker platform has ushered in a new era of AI-powered business intelligence, making data exploration and analysis more accessible and insightful than ever before.\nThe AI-powered capabilities that we introduced in the past year are fundamentally changing how users interact with their data:\nConversational Analytics: Users can now ask complex questions of their data in natural language and instantly receive intelligent, visualized answers. This empowers business users to self-serve their data needs without writing a single line of code, freeing up data teams to focus on more strategic initiatives.\nCode Interpreter in Conversational Analytics translates your natural-language questions into Python code, and executes that code to provide advanced analysis and visualizations. This helps with more complex scenarios, such as “what if” questions, period-over-period growth analysis and more.\nAI-powered development: Every action in the Looker platform is powered by Google’s Gemini models, accelerating all of your BI actions, from writing and debugging LookML, developing robust and reliable data models, to building new reports and slides.\nAutomated slide generation and formula creation: With Google’s latest Gemini models, Looker re-envisions the way you create and share information in the AI age. You can create Google Slides presentations with insightful chart summaries in seconds, or tap into the formula assistant to build calculated fields that leverage metrics and dimensions based on your own unique data.\nLooker agents, leveraging the Conversational Analytics API, will soon be available in Agentspace, providing a central repository for discovery and access so they are simple to deploy and manage. \nGoogle-easy data storytelling with Looker reports\nBuilding on our commitment to flexible and powerful data visualization, we introduced a new, more intuitive Looker reports experience. This reimagined reporting capability provides a beautiful and collaborative canvas for data exploration and storytelling, complete with:\nEnhanced visualization capabilities: New chart types and customization options give users more control over how they present their data to tell compelling narratives.\nSimplified, collaborative workflows: The new reporting interface makes it easier than ever to build, share, and collaborate on reports, fostering a more inclusive data culture.\nResponsive canvas: Reports are now more responsive, for a smooth viewing experience across screen sizes for devices ranging from desktops, to tablets, to mobile.\nEmpowering developers and embedded experiences\nAt Looker, we know the only limitations on developer creativity are those you set on yourself. That is, unless tools get in the way. With that in mind, we continue to invest heavily in the developer experience.\nOur new Conversational Analytics API allows you to embed natural-language querying directly into your applications and workflows, unlocking a new level of interactivity and user engagement for embedded analytics experiences. When applied in combination with Looker Embedded and the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard, developers can now build and design custom conversational agents for BI for their own applications and innovations.\nAgentspace will serve as a centralized hub for managing and sharing Looker agents, enhancing discoverability and simplifying deployment. With this approach, teams can quickly leverage AI-powered insights and share agents across teams, promoting a more data-driven culture. And with the Agent Development Kit announced at Google Cloud Next ‘25, Google is providing a rich model and tooling ecosystem designed for multi-agent capabilities.\nCode Interpreter in Conversational Analytics enables users to perform advanced analysis that historically has required specialized knowledge of advanced coding or statistical methods. Code Interpreter excels at questions that go beyond the scope of the standard BI query, such as \"What were the key drivers of sales in my data?\" or \"What were our quarterly sales in 2023 and 2024, and what was the quarter-over-quarter growth?\". Also, we know that in the world of AI-powered data, an answer holds little value if you can’t verify how it was generated. That's why Code Interpreter shows its work. For every answer it produces, you can expand a \"How is this calculated?\" section to see the exact Python code that was run, ensuring it's not a black box.\nWe also know developers need to trust that their applications and dashboards are accurate and will build properly every time. To enhance the reliability and speed of LookML development, the Spectacles.dev team joined Google Cloud, and is working hard to deliver powerful continuous integration (CI) and automated testing capabilities to the Looker platform, helping to ensure data quality and consistency at scale.\nBringing trust to every gen-AI-powered business\nIn the AI era, data drives your business, your apps and your decisions. You need your data to be accurate and consistent, but that hasn’t always been the case with traditional tools. In this new world, trusted definitions managed by a semantic layer are a must-have, backed by unique information about your business. It is not enough to have reports and dashboards be available or simply delightful — they must take full advantage of data agents for specific use cases, or be embedded in third-party apps that your organization uses every day. \nThe combination of Looker's powerful semantic model with Google's leading AI capabilities delivers a new foundation for business intelligence — one that is more intelligent, intuitive, and impactful than ever before. Our own testing shows that by building with Looker’s semantic layer, data errors in gen AI natural language queries are reduced by as much as two thirds. Data consistency and quality are top priorities for modern organizations. We are building for this moment.\nTo download the full 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms report, click here, and for more information on Looker see here.\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms - Anirudh Ganeshan, Edgar Macari, Jamie O'Brien, Kurt Schlegel, Christopher Long, June 16, 2025 \nGARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and MAGIC QUADRANT is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and are used herein with permission.

    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/technical/build-ai-memory-systems-mongodb-atlas-aws-claude",
    "description": "When working with conversational AI, most developers fall into a familiar trap: They treat memory as simple storage—write data in, read data out. But human memory doesn't work this way. Our brains actively evaluate information importance, strengthen connections through repetition, and let irrelevant details fade over time. This disconnect creates AI systems that either remember too much (overwhelming users with irrelevant details) or too little (forgetting critical context). The stakes are significant: Without sophisticated memory management, AI assistants can't provide truly personalized experiences, maintain consistent personalities, or build meaningful relationships with users.\nThe application we're exploring represents a paradigm shift—treating AI memory not as a database problem but as a cognitive architecture challenge. This transforms AI memory from passive storage into an active, evolving knowledge network.\nA truly intelligent cognitive memory isn't one that never forgets, but one that forgets with intention and remembers with purpose.\nImagine an AI assistant that doesn't just store information but builds a living, adaptive memory system that carefully evaluates, reinforces, and connects knowledge just like a human brain. This isn't science fiction—it's achievable today by combining MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with AWS Bedrock and Anthropic's Claude. You'll move from struggling with fragmented AI memory systems to building sophisticated knowledge networks that evolve organically, prioritize important information, and recall relevant context exactly when needed.\nThe cognitive architecture of AI memory\nAt its simplest, our memory system mimics three core aspects of human memory:\nImportance-weighted storage: Not all memories are equally valuable.\nReinforcement through repetition: Important concepts strengthen over time.\nContextual retrieval: Memories are recalled based on relevance to current context.\nThis approach differs fundamentally from traditional conversation storage:\nTraditional conversation storage\n\t\t\t\t\tCognitive memory architecture\n        \nFlat history retention\n\t\t\t\t\tHierarchical knowledge graph\n        \nEqual weighting of all information\n\t\t\t\t\tImportance-based prioritization\n        \nKeyword or vector-only search\n\t\t\t\t\tHybrid semantic & keyword retrieval\n        \nFixed memory lifetime\n\t\t\t\tDynamic reinforcement & decay\n\t\t\t\nIsolated conversation fragments\n\t\t\t\tConnected knowledge network\n\t\t\t\nThe practical implication is an AI that \"thinks\" before remembering—evaluating what information to prioritize, how to connect it with existing knowledge, and when to let less important details fade.\nLet's build a minimum viable implementation of this cognitive memory architecture using MongoDB Atlas, AWS Bedrock, and Anthropic's Claude. Our focus will be on creating the fundamental components that make this system work.\nService architecture\nThe following service architecture defines the foundational components and their interactions that power the cognitive memory system.\nFigure 1. AI memory service architecture.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBuilt on AWS infrastructure, this comprehensive architecture connects user interactions with sophisticated memory management processes. The User Interface (Client application) serves as the entry point where humans interact with the system, sending messages and receiving AI responses enriched with conversation summaries and relevant contextual memories.\nAt the centre sits the AI Memory Service, the critical processing hub that coordinates information flow, processes messages, and manages memory operations across the entire system. MongoDB Atlas provides a scalable, secure, multi-cloud database foundation.\nThe system processes data through the following key functions:\nBedrock Titan Embeddings for converting text to vector representations.\nMemory Reinforcement for strengthening important information.\nRelevance-based Retrieval for finding contextually appropriate memories.\nAnthropic’s Claude LLM handles the importance assessment to evaluate long-term storage value, memory merging for efficient information organization, and conversation summary generation.\nThis architecture ultimately enables AI systems to maintain contextual awareness across conversations, providing more natural, consistent, and personalized interactions over time.\nDatabase structure\nThe database structure organizes information storage with specialized collections and indexes that enable efficient semantic retrieval and importance-based memory management.\nFigure 2. Example of a database structure.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe database design strategically separates raw conversation data from processed memory nodes to optimize performance and functionality. The Conversations Collection maintains chronological records of all interactions, preserving the complete historical context, while the Memory Nodes Collection stores higher-level semantic information with importance ratings that facilitate cognitive prioritization. Vector Search Indexes enable efficient semantic similarity searches with O(log n) performance, allowing the system to rapidly identify contextually relevant information regardless of database size. To manage storage growth automatically, TTL(Time-To-Live) Indexes expire older conversations based on configurable retention policies. Finally, Importance and User ID indexes optimize retrieval patterns critical to the system's function, ensuring that high-priority information and user-specific context can be accessed with minimal latency.\nMemory node structure\nThe Memory node structure defines the data schemas that combine content with cognitive metadata to enable human-like memory operations.\nFigure 3. The memory node structure.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEach node includes an importance score that enables memory prioritization similar to human memory processes, allowing the system to focus on what matters most. The structure tracks access count, which facilitates reinforcement learning by recording how frequently memories are retrieved. A critical feature is the summary field, providing quick semantic access without processing the full content, significantly improving efficiency. Vector embeddings within each node enable powerful semantic search capabilities that mirror human associative thought, connecting related concepts across the knowledge base. Complementing this, the ConversationMessage structure preserves raw conversational context without interpretation, maintaining the original exchange integrity. Both structures incorporate vector embeddings as a unifying feature, enabling sophisticated semantic operations that allow the system to navigate information based on meaning rather than just keywords, creating a more human-like cognitive architecture.\nMemory creation process\nThe memory creation process transforms conversational exchanges into structured memory nodes through a cognitive pipeline mimicking human memory formation by thoughtfully evaluating new information against existing knowledge, rather than indiscriminately storing everything.\nFigure 3. The memory creation process.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThrough repetition, memories are strengthened via reinforcement, similar to human cognitive processes. At its core, the LLM functions as an \"importance evaluator\" that assigns each memory a value on a 1-10 scale, reflecting how humans naturally prioritize information based on relevance, uniqueness, and utility. This importance rating directly affects a memory's persistence, recall probability, and survival during pruning operations. As the system evolves, memory merging simulates the human brain's ability to consolidate related concepts over time, while importance updating reflects how new discoveries change our perception of existing knowledge. The framework's pruning mechanism mirrors our natural forgetting of less significant information. Rather than simply accumulating data, this dynamic system creates an evolving memory architecture that continuously refines itself through processes remarkably similar to human cognition.\nMemory retrieval process\nThe memory retrieval process leverages multiple search methodologies that optimize both recall and precision to find and contextualize relevant information across conversations and memory nodes.\nFigure 4. The memory retrieval process.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhen initiated, the system converts user queries into vector embeddings while simultaneously executing parallel operations to enhance performance. The core of this system is its hybrid search methodology that combines vector-based semantic understanding with traditional text-based keyword search, allowing it to capture both conceptual similarities and exact term matches. The process directly searches memory nodes and applies different weighting algorithms to combine scores from various search methods, producing a comprehensive relevance ranking.\nAfter identifying relevant memories, the system fetches surrounding conversation context to ensure retrieved information maintains appropriate background, followed by generating concise summaries that distill essential insights. A key innovation is the effective importance calculation that dynamically adjusts memory significance based on access patterns and other usage metrics. The final step involves building a comprehensive response package that integrates the original memories, their summaries, relevance scores, and contextual information, providing users with a complete understanding of retrieved information without requiring exhaustive reading of all content. This multi-faceted approach ensures that memory retrieval is both comprehensive and precisely tailored to user needs.\nCode execution flowchart\nThe code execution flowchart provides a comprehensive mapping of how API requests navigate through the system architecture, illuminating the runtime path from initial client interaction to final response delivery.\nFigure 5. The code execution flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhen a request enters the system, it first encounters the FastAPI endpoint, which serves as the primary entry point for all client communications. From there, specialized API route handlers direct the request to appropriate processing functions based on its type and intent.\nDuring processing, the system creates and stores message objects in the database, ensuring a permanent record of all conversation interactions. For human-generated messages meeting specific significance criteria, a parallel memory creation branch activates, analyzing the content for long-term storage. This selective approach preserves only meaningful information while reducing storage overhead.\nThe system then processes queries through embedding generation, transforming natural language into vector representations that enable semantic understanding. One of the most sophisticated aspects is the implementation of parallel search functions that simultaneously execute different retrieval strategies, dramatically improving response times while maintaining comprehensive result quality. These searches connect to MongoDB Atlas to perform complex database operations against the stored knowledge base.\nRetrieved information undergoes context enrichment and summary generation, where the AWS Bedrock (Anthropic’s Claude) LLM augments raw data with contextual understanding and concise overviews of relevant conversation history. Finally, the response combination module assembles diverse data components—semantic matches, text-based results, contextual information, and generated summaries—into a coherent, tailored response that addresses the original request.\nThe system's behavior can be fine-tuned through configurable parameters that govern memory processing, AI model selection, database structure, and service operations, allowing for optimization without code modifications.\nMemory updating process\nThe memory updating process dynamically adjusts memory importance through sophisticated reinforcement and decay mechanisms that mimic human cognitive functions.\nFigure 6. The memory updating process.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhen new information arrives, the system first retrieves all existing user memories from the database, then methodically calculates similarity scores between this new content and each stored memory. Memories exceeding a predetermined similarity threshold are identified as conceptually related and undergo importance reinforcement and access count incrementation, strengthening their position in the memory hierarchy. Simultaneously, unrelated memories experience gradual decay as their importance values diminish over time, creating a naturally evolving memory landscape. This balanced approach prevents memory saturation by ensuring that frequently accessed topics remain prominent while less relevant information gracefully fades. The system maintains a comprehensive usage history through access counts, which informs more effective importance calculations and provides valuable metadata for memory management. All these adjustments are persistently stored in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring continuity across user sessions and maintaining a dynamic memory ecosystem that evolves with each interaction.\nClient integration flow\nThe following diagram illustrates the complete interaction sequence between client applications and the memory system, from message processing to memory retrieval. This flow encompasses two primary pathways:\nMessage sending flow: When a client sends a message, it triggers a sophisticated processing chain where the API routes it to the Conversation Service, which generates embeddings via AWS Bedrock. After storing the message in MongoDB Atlas, the Memory Service evaluates it for potential memory creation, performing importance assessment and summary generation before creating or updating a memory node in the database. The flow culminates with a confirmation response returning to the client. Check out the code reference on Github.\nMemory retrieval flow: During retrieval, the client's request initiates parallel search operations where query embeddings are generated simultaneously across conversation history and memory nodes. These dual search paths—conversation search and memory node search—produce results that are intelligently combined and summarized to provide contextual understanding. The client ultimately receives a comprehensive memory package containing all relevant information. Check out the code reference on Github.\nFigure 7. The client integration flow.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe architecture deliberately separates conversation storage from memory processing, with MongoDB Atlas serving as the central persistence layer. Each component maintains clear responsibilities and interfaces, ensuring that despite complex internal processing, clients receive unified, coherent responses.\nAction plan: Bringing your AI memory system to life\nTo implement your own AI memory system:\nStart with the core components: MongoDB Atlas, AWS Bedrock, and Anthropic’s Claude.\nFocus on cognitive functions: Importance assessment, memory reinforcement, relevance-based retrieval, and memory merging\nTune parameters iteratively: Start with the defaults provided, then adjust based on your application's needs.\nMeasure the right metrics: Track uniqueness of memories, retrieval precision, and user satisfaction—not just storage efficiency.\nTo evaluate your implementation, ask these questions:\nDoes your system effectively prioritize truly important information?\nCan it recall relevant context without excessive prompting?\nDoes it naturally form connections between related concepts?\nCan users perceive the system's improving memory over time?\nReal-world applications and insights\nCase Study: From repetitive Q&A to evolving knowledge\nA customer service AI using traditional approaches typically needs to relearn user preferences repeatedly. With our cognitive memory architecture:\nFirst interaction: User mentions they prefer email communication. The system stores this with moderate importance.\nSecond interaction: User confirms email preference. The system reinforces this memory, increasing its importance.\nFuture interactions: The system consistently recalls email preference without asking again, but might still verify after long periods due to natural decay.\nThe result? A major reduction in repetitive questions, leading to a significantly better user experience.\nBenefits\nApplications implementing this approach achieved unexpected benefits:\nEmergent knowledge graphs: Over time, the system naturally forms conceptual clusters of related information.\nInsight mining: Analysis of high-importance memories across users reveals shared concerns and interests not obvious from raw conversation data.\nReduced compute costs: Despite the sophisticated architecture, the selective nature of memory storage reduces overall embedding and storage costs compared to retaining full conversation histories.\nLimitations\nWhen implementing this system, teams typically face three key challenges:\nConfiguration tuning: Finding the right balance of importance thresholds, decay rates, and reinforcement factors requires experimentation.\nPrompt engineering: Getting consistent, numeric importance ratings from LLMs requires careful prompt design. Our implementation uses clear constraints and numeric-only output requirements.\nMemory sizing: Determining the optimal memory depth per user depends on the application context. Too shallow and the AI seems forgetful; too deep and it becomes sluggish.\nFuture directions\nThe landscape for AI memory systems is evolving rapidly. Here are key developments on the horizon:\nShort-term developments\nEmotion-aware memory: Extending importance evaluation to include emotional salience, remembering experiences that evoke strong reactions.\nTemporal awareness: Adding time-based decay that varies by information type (factual vs. preferential).\nMulti-modal memory: Incorporating image and voice embeddings alongside text for unified memory systems.\nLong-term possibilities\nSelf-supervised memory optimization: Systems that learn optimal importance ratings, decay rates, and memory structures based on user satisfaction.\nCausal memory networks: Moving beyond associative memory to create causal models of user intent and preferences.\nPrivacy-preserving memory: Implementing differential privacy and selective forgetting capabilities to respect user privacy boundaries.\nThis approach to AI memory is still evolving. The future of AI isn't just about more parameters or faster inference—it's about creating systems that learn and remember more like humans do. With the cognitive memory architecture we've explored, you're well on your way to building AI that remembers what matters.\nTransform your AI applications with cognitive memory capabilities today.

    "url": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/creative-phishing-academics-critics-of-russia/",
    "description": "Written by: Gabby Roncone, Wesley Shields\n\n\nIn cooperation with external partners, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) observed a Russia state-sponsored cyber threat actor impersonating the U.S. Department of State. From at least April through early June 2025, this actor targeted prominent academics and critics of Russia, often using extensive rapport building and tailored lures to convince the target to set up application specific passwords (ASPs). Once the target shares the ASP passcode, the attackers establish persistent access to the victim’s mailbox. Two distinct campaigns are detailed in this post. This activity aligns with Citizen Lab’s recent research on social engineering attacks against ASPs, another useful resource for high risk users.\nGTIG tracks this activity as UNC6293, a likely Russia state-sponsored cyber actor we assess with low confidence is associated with APT29 / ICECAP. After establishing rapport, the attacker sent phishing lures disguised as meeting invitations, and added spoofed Department of State email addresses on the cc line of the initial outreach to increase the legitimacy of the contact attempt. The initial phishing email itself is not directly malicious, but encourages the victim to respond to set up a meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nFigure 1: Keir Giles, a prominent British researcher on Russia, posted this screenshot of an email header with fake U.S. Department of State emails that was part of a UNC6293 campaign\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nTargets who responded received an email with a benign PDF lure attached. The State Department themed lure is customized to the target and contains instructions to securely access a fake Department of State cloud environment. This included directing victims to go to https://account.google.com and create an Application Specific Password (ASP) or “app passwords.” ASPs are randomly generated 16-character passcodes that allow third-party applications to access your Google Account, intended for applications and devices that do not support features like 2-step verification (2SV). To use an ASP you must set it up and provide a name for the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nFigure 2: Benign PDF document with instructions\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nIn campaign one, the ASP name suggested in the lure PDF was “ms.state.gov” and in campaign two, we observed a Ukrainian and Microsoft themed ASP name. After creating the ASP, the attackers directed the target to send them the 16-character code. The attackers then set up a mail client to use the ASP, likely with the end goal of accessing and reading the victim’s email correspondence. This method also allows the attackers to have persistent access to accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign \nSender Theme\nASP Name\nAttacker Infrastructure Used\nCampaign 1\nState Department\nms.state.gov\n91.190.191.117 - Residential proxy\nCampaign 2\nUnknown\nUkrainian and Microsoft-themed ASP\n91.190.191.117 - Residential proxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttackers logged into victim accounts primarily using residential proxies and VPS servers, in some cases re-using infrastructure to access different victim or attacker accounts. As a result, we were able to connect the two distinct campaigns we observed to the same cluster. We have re-secured the Gmail accounts compromised by these campaigns.\nMitigations\nGTIG is committed to our mission of understanding and countering advanced threats. We use the results of our research to ensure that Google's products are secure and to protect our users and enterprise customers. \nUsers have complete control over their ASPs and may create or revoke them on demand. Upon creation, Google sends a notification to the corresponding account Gmail, recovery email address, and any device signed in with that Google account to ensure the user intended to enable this form of authentication. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nFigure 3: Google Account Help documentation on app passwords\n\n      \n    \n\n  \n      \nGoogle provides enhanced security resources such as the Advanced Protection Program (APP), intended for individuals at high risk of targeted attacks and exposure to other serious threats. Opting to use the APP prevents an account from creating an ASP due to the program’s heightened security requirements.\nWe are committed to sharing our findings with the security community and with companies and individuals that may have been targeted by these activities, and we hope that improved understanding of tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting capabilities and lead to stronger user protections across the industry.\nLure PDF Document\nSHA256: 329fda9939930e504f47d30834d769b30ebeaced7d73f3c1aadd0e48320d6b39",

    "description": "In a world where software drives business strategy, data resilience has become a core business imperative. In fact, 90% of IT and security leaders report their organizations experienced a cyberattack in the past year, with 18% facing more than 25 attacks.1 Every mission-critical workload must be secure, compliant, and able to recover quickly from any disruption.\nTo help customers meet these demands, MongoDB is introducing a major data resilience enhancement: third-party backup integrations in MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. As the most flexible way to run MongoDB across on-premises, private, or hybrid cloud environments, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced now makes it even easier to integrate with customers’ existing enterprise backup tools.\nPreviously, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers relied on our self-hosted database management platform, MongoDB Ops Manager, to handle backup and restore operations. For the first time, MongoDB Ops Manager now supports certified integrations with trusted vendors Cohesity and Rubrik. This enables organizations to unify MongoDB backups with the platforms they already use, streamlining operations and reinforcing existing resilience and compliance strategies.\nStreamlined and secure backups for enterprises\nAs modern applications grow more complex, backup requirements scale alongside them. Enterprises managing multi-terabyte workloads or operating in highly regulated environments often need tailored solutions that match their infrastructure standards and processes. Policies may also require cold storage, where backup snapshots are stored for the long term.\nCohesity DataProtect and Rubrik Security Cloud are two trusted solutions for securely backing up large volumes of data and recovering with minimal downtime. While MongoDB Ops Manager offers native backup features, these integrations provide alternatives for customers with specific vendor preferences or compliance mandates without compromising on resilience or speed.\nThese integrations enable customers to run MongoDB on-premises or in private or hybrid clouds and:\nReduce complexity by consolidating backup management into existing enterprise tools.\nStreamline recovery using familiar vendor platforms optimized for scale.\nSupport compliance through enterprise-grade features like backup immutability and policy enforcement.\nDeliver greater support for sophisticated backup policies, including long-term storage of snapshots.\nEasy startup\nGetting started with third-party backup integrations for MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is straightforward. While the bulk of the configuration is handled on the backup provider’s side (Cohesity DataProtect or Rubrik Security Cloud), there are a few setup steps within Ops Manager to ensure a successful integration:\nEnabling the integration: Setting a feature flag to enable third-party backup management.\nGenerating API keys: Creating global and project-level API keys to enable secure communication with MongoDB Ops Manager.\nInstalling MongoDB Agents: Deploying the MongoDB Ops Manager agent on each server in the cluster.\nSetting permissions: Verifying that agents have read/write access to the configured directory.\nConnecting third-party software: Using the generated API keys to integrate with Cohesity DataProtect or Rubrik Security Cloud.\nSynchronizing system clocks: Ensuring consistent timestamps across machines using Network Time Protocol.\nConfiguring the oplog export path: Defining a directory for MongoDB to store oplog data.\nActivating monitoring and backup: Turning on both services for each server.\nMarking the deployment as third-party managed: Using the UI or API to flag the cluster.\nFor detailed setup and integration guidance, refer to the MongoDB Ops Manager documentation, as well as the Cohesity demo and Rubrik demo.\nWith these steps complete, backup operations are managed through the third-party platform—no additional complexity inside MongoDB.\nFor more information on these integrations, check out the announcements from Cohesity and Rubrik.",

    "description": "Here at Grafana Labs, our commitment to our “big tent” philosophy runs deep. We prioritize interoperability and flexibility within our observability solutions, and believe you should be able to connect to and visualize data from a wide range of sources, including both open source and commercial technologies.\nOur rich ecosystem of\nGrafana data sources directly reflects these values — and today, we’re excited to share a recent milestone related to that ecosystem.\nGrafana Labs has successfully achieved the Google Cloud Ready – BigQuery designation for our\nGoogle Cloud BigQuery data source for Grafana. \nGoogle Cloud Ready - BigQuery is a partner integration validation program that intends to increase customer confidence in partner integrations with\nBigQuery. \nBy earning this designation, we’ve proven that our data source has met a core set of functional and interoperability requirements when integrating Grafana with BigQuery. Being part of the program also means we’ll get more opportunities to collaborate closely with Google Cloud partner engineering and BigQuery teams to develop roadmaps.\nIn this post, we’ll provide a brief overview of our Google Cloud BigQuery data source for Grafana, highlight key features, and offer some helpful resources to get started.\n\nThe Google Cloud BigQuery data source for Grafana: overview and key features \nOur Google Cloud BigQuery data source allows you to query and visualize data from Google Cloud BigQuery — a fully managed, serverless, and AI-ready data platform hosted on Google Cloud — within Grafana.\nKey features of the Google Cloud BigQuery data source for Grafana include:\nQuery and visualization: Visualize Google Cloud BigQuery data directly within Grafana dashboards, supporting both time series and table visualizations. You can use\nmacros to simplify syntax and make queries dynamic, such as filtering by time ranges.\nFlexible authentication: The data source supports authentication via\nGoogle Service Account keys (JWT),\nVM metadata server (when running on Google Cloud Compute Engine), and\nWorkload Identity Federation (when running on Google Kubernetes Engine), making it adaptable to different deployment scenarios. \nSQL query editor: Use a powerful SQL editor with rich autocompletion for BigQuery standard SQL, datasets, tables, columns, macros, and template variables. \nVisual query editor: Don’t want to write SQL? No worries. The data source also includes a visual query editor with support for basic aggregations, filtering, grouping, ordering, and raw query previews.\nIn addition, the plugin integrates with the\nGoogle Cloud Resource Manager API, allowing you to access multiple Google Cloud projects from a single data source in Grafana. These and other features provide a robust solution for integrating BigQuery data into your Grafana observability workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more and next steps\nTo learn more about the Google Cloud BigQuery data source for Grafana, including how to install, configure, and provision the data source, please visit our\nplugin catalog page. \nYou can also learn more about our broad ecosystem of data source plugins for Grafana in\nthis blog post and by watching this\nwebinar. \n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case.\nSign up for free now!",

    "url": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/backup-vaults-add-support-for-disk-backup-and-multi-region/",
    "description": "To help protect against evolving digital threats like ransomware and malicious deletions, last year, we introduced backup vault in the Google Cloud Backup and DR service, with support for Compute Engine VM backups. This provided immutable and indelible backup capabilities for mission-critical VMs, for both VM metadata and all their attached disks.\nToday, we're announcing two enhancements to backup vaults that can help you protect more types of workloads, better:\nBackup vaults now support standalone Persistent Disk (PD) and Hyperdisk backups. Now in preview, it enables the direct backup of data on individual disks, providing a granular alternative to backing up the entire virtual machine.\nBackup vaults can now be created in multi-region locations. Now generally available it supports regional data resilience and helping to meet business continuity requirements.\nImmutability and indelibility \nTraditional backups have a well-known vulnerability. If a malicious actor gains access to your environment, if they attempt to delete or corrupt the backup, preventing recovery and thus causing business loss, there is nothing preventing this from happening. This is where backup vaults fundamentally change the game.\nA backup vault provides a secure, isolated storage environment in Google-managed projects that helps ensure your backups are immutable (secured against data modification) and indelible (secured against data deletion), providing protection against cyber attacks such as ransomware. When creating a backup vault, you can specify that vaulted backups must be secured against modification and deletion — even by a backup administrator who would traditionally have the ability to expire backups — until the specified minimum enforced retention timeframe has elapsed. \nOnce a backup is stored in a vault, it's logically air-gapped from your Google Cloud project, and cannot be changed during its user-defined enforced retention period. This means:\nNo deletion: The backup can’t be accidentally or deliberately deleted before its enforced retention period expires.\nNo alteration: The backup data cannot be changed, and remains exactly as it was when it was created.\nThis gives you the confidence that your crucial recovery points have not been modified, so they are available when you need them.\n\n\nBackup Vault now supports Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk\nMany applications rely on the durable storage provided by Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk. With support for Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk in addition to Compute Engine VMs, backup vaults now offer a holistic defense strategy for your entire compute environment:\nFor your VMs: Backup vaults can help protect your Compute Engine VMs (including VM metadata and all the attached disks). They can provide rapid and secure recovery of operating systems, configurations, application binaries, and all associated disks.\nFor critical data disks: Now you can secure specific Persistent Disks and Hyperdisks that contain application data, databases, and file shares. They can provide granular protection, for scenarios where a full VM backup isn't necessary, or you want to optimize costs.\nThis integrated approach ensures that whether you need to restore an entire VM or a specific disk, your recovery points are secured in a backup vault. \nKey benefits of unified backup vault protection\nBy centralizing your Compute Engine VM, Persistent Disk, and Hyperdisk backups within backup vaults, you gain a powerful suite of advantages that transform your data protection strategy from reactive to proactively resilient:\nUnified interface for easy management: Easily define and enforce consistent backup policies (including backup frequency and retention period) across your entire organization. Manage backups for your Compute Engine VMs, Persistent Disks, and Hyperdisks from a unified interface, even across multiple Google Cloud projects, simplifying administration.\nComprehensive monitoring and reporting: Benefit from centralized monitoring, detailed reporting, and timely alerting capabilities that streamline your day-to-day backup management. This enhanced visibility also significantly aids in meeting stringent audit and compliance requirements by providing clear, verifiable records of your backup posture.\nProactive security integration: Elevate your overall security posture with integration to Security Command Center, enabling proactive detection of anomalous activities, such as unauthorized backup deletion attempts or suspicious policy changes, so you can respond swiftly and decisively to threats.\nReduced operational complexity: Consolidate your backup management processes, moving away from disparate, script-based, or manual solutions. Backup and DR service provides a streamlined, fully managed service that simplifies operations, reduces human error, and frees up valuable IT resources, so you can focus on innovation.\nHere's how it works\nCreate a backup vault: Begin by establishing a secure backup vault. This vault acts as your designated, isolated, and highly protected storage destination for all your managed backups.\nDefine a backup plan: Next, create a comprehensive backup plan, specifying parameters such as the desired backup frequency (how often your disks will be backed up), backup retention period, and designating the specific backup vault where the backup data will be stored.\nSchedule your backups: Now you are ready to apply your backup plan to your desired Persistent Disks or Hyperdisks. The Backup and DR service automatically takes incremental crash-consistent backups according to your defined schedule, with no manual intervention on your part.\nOnce these backups are created and stored in your designated vault, the vault’s enforced retention policy is automatically applied, making the backups immutable and indelible for the specified enforced retention period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nSecure disaster recovery with multi-region backup vaults\nIn addition, you can now create backup vaults in Google-managed, multi-region locations. When using a multi-region backup vault, data is stored in more than one geographic region, thereby providing the security benefits of backup vault, while also making critical backup data available during unforeseen events. \nUsing multi-region backup vaults lets you:\nRetain data access: Maintain accessibility and recoverability of critical backup data during a regional service disruption (such as natural disasters, power outages).\nSatisfy business continuity requirements: Instill confidence in your business operations with your ability to perform on-demand, backup-based recoveries.\nSecure your data: Retain all of the critical security benefits delivered by backup vaults.\nMulti-region backup vault storage is generally available and currently supports Compute Engine full VM backups and disk backups to supported Locations. Complete this form to request access to the new feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \nProtect all your critical Compute Engine data\nWith the addition of multi-region backup vaults and disk-level backup, Backup and DR service can secure and recover critical Compute Engine data better than ever.

    "url": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/spanner-wins-the-2025-acm-sigmod-systems-award/",
    "description": "Earlier this year, the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Management of Data (ACM SIGMOD) announced that Spanner, Google's globally distributed database, was awarded the 2025 SIGMOD Systems Award. The SIGMOD Systems Award specifically honors systems whose technical contributions have profoundly impacted the theory or practice of large-scale data management. On behalf of the entire Spanner team, especially the engineers who were there at the beginning of Spanner's journey, it is with deep humility and immense pride that we receive this recognition from such a distinguished community. We’re thrilled to be participating in the 2025 SIGMOD conference from June 22-27 in Berlin, Germany as a Platinum sponsor.\nThis honor feels particularly significant following Spanner's 2022 SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award, which highlighted the crucial role of technologies like TrueTime and our network infrastructure, reaffirming the lasting significance of the original vision laid out in the first Spanner paper.\nSpanner’s core innovation: TrueTime and external consistency\nFor Spanner to be recognized in this way is a powerful affirmation of the vision we set out to achieve years ago and the new ways Spanner enables applications to be built. According to the award citation, Spanner is recognized “for reimagining relational data management to enable serializability with external consistency at global scale.”\nWhy “reimagining”? Before Spanner, databases offered a stark choice: you could have ACID transactions and SQL, or you could have scale and multi-datacenter reliability. Scale and availability required a distributed system, and that meant eventual consistency and other forms of best-effort synchronization. Spanner showed that this choice was not fundamental — that it was possible to build a database that offered the horizontal scalability of a distributed system with the power and ease of use of transactions and SQL. It enabled companies for whom scale is job #1 to regain developer velocity and agility. Spanner drastically simplifies the logic required in distributed applications. Developers can reason about the state of the database as if it were a single, consistent entity, even when it spans the globe.\nThe key enabler for Spanner's ability to deliver external consistency is TrueTime. Beyond just a synchronized global clock, TrueTime is an API that cleverly exposes clock uncertainty as a bounded interval, which allows higher-level algorithms to reason about the ordering of events. Google’s TrueTime implementation uses specialized hardware references like GPS receivers and atomic clocks to provide highly trustworthy and very tight time bounds. Spanner leverages this bounded uncertainty to achieve external consistency. When a transaction commits, Spanner assigns it a commit timestamp derived from TrueTime. Spanner then enforces a \"commit wait\" — which can be overlapped with making the transaction durable – to ensure that the commit timestamp is definitively in the past before making the transaction's effects visible. This ensures that the assigned commit timestamps definitively reflect the true global serialization order of transactions, even across data centers. The result is remarkable: external consistency with no performance cost.\n Addressing the consistency-scale dilemma\nTo truly appreciate the journey, it helps to travel back to the early and mid-2000s at Google. The internet was exploding, and our biggest challenge was scaling our software infrastructure to keep pace. We needed databases that could store and process a copy of the internet using vast fleets of commodity servers. This spurred the development of internal systems that delivered incredible performance and scalability, but they came with trade-offs.\nAs we gained more familiarity with these systems, and started using them to build big interactive applications like Gmail, we consistently heard from internal developers about the challenge of working with eventual consistency and cross-shard synchronization, as well as the friction of modeling every problem (no matter how complex) as key-value pairs. It quickly became apparent that we needed to build a globally distributed database that offered the familiarity and guarantees of traditional relational databases — including ACID transactions, serializability, and external consistency — without giving up Google’s ever-growing need for bigger databases serving bigger audiences. Moreover, working closely with our customers, it became clear that actually, it was something we could build. The rest is history!\nSpanner as a cloud service\nAs a cornerstone of Google's infrastructure, Spanner powers some of our most critical, planet-scale services, including Google Ads, Google Search indexing, Gmail, YouTube, Google Photos, metadata for Cloud Storage, and BigQuery, demonstrating its robustness and scalability under extreme load.\nThe next logical step was to make these capabilities available externally to customers through Google Cloud. The launch and subsequent evolution of  Spanner aimed to democratize this technology, bringing the power of a globally consistent, scalable database to organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises, simplifying their application development and operations.\nSpanner’s core value proposition for customers stems directly from its unique architecture:\nGlobal scale with strong consistency: Spanner delivers on the original promise: ACID transactions with external consistency across a database that can scale horizontally across regions and continents, automatically managing data distribution (sharding) as needed. This directly addresses the capability highlighted by the SIGMOD award.  \nUnmatched availability: Leveraging synchronous, Paxos-based replication across multiple zones or regions, Spanner offers an industry-leading 99.999% availability Service Level Agreement (SLA) for multi-region configurations. This helps provide extreme fault tolerance and minimizes downtime risk for mission-critical applications.  \nSimplified operations: As a fully managed service, Spanner automates complex operational tasks like sharding, replication management, backups, and maintenance. This frees development teams from significant operational burdens, allowing them to focus on building applications rather than managing database infrastructure. This contrasts sharply with the manual effort often required for traditional sharded databases or the complexity of implementing consistency logic at the application layer for NoSQL systems.  \nDeveloper productivity: Spanner offers familiar SQL query interfaces, supporting both Google SQL and PostgreSQL dialects, which significantly flattens the learning curve for developers. Furthermore, its strong consistency eliminates entire classes of complex problems related to data synchronization and reconciliation that often plague applications built on eventually consistent systems.  \nEmpowering customers and industries\nOf course, today’s data landscape has changed since we published the first Spanner paper in 2012. In the modern AI-first data world, we see customers more focused than ever on getting full value from their data, which is often spread out over many systems with different data models, varying scalability, and uneven reliability. We’re addressing these new challenges head on, introducing Spanner Graph, vector search for AI applications, and integrated full-text search. These allow you to bring together a wide range of data and iterate on it rapidly within a single, consistent, scalable platform. We've also helped you run even more cost-effectively as your data grows, with increased compute and storage density, tiered pricing through editions, and cost-optimizing features such as tiered storage. Finally, we’ve made it easier to bring scale-out workloads into Spanner through enhanced interoperability with tools and capabilities, such as  Cassandra-compatible APIs.\nWhile academic recognition such as the SIGMOD award is gratifying, we’ve always felt that the true measure of a system's impact lies in how it empowers users to solve real-world problems and build innovative applications. Spanner's unique combination of capabilities have proven transformative across various industries.\nIn financial services, where consistency, availability, and security are paramount, Spanner provides the foundation for many critical systems. Companies like Goldman Sachs use it to consolidate trade ledgers, while others like Arigato Bank rely on it to handle high volumes of financial transactions with perfect consistency, even during peak loads. Digital-native banks like Minna Bank have built their entire infrastructure on Spanner, leveraging its availability and consistency to meet stringent regulatory requirements and customer expectations.\nThe gaming industry is constantly pushing the boundaries of scale and real-time interaction. Spanner has helped game developers launch globally successful titles like Dragon Quest Walk by Colopl, handling millions of concurrent players from day one. Its ability to manage player profiles, in-game inventory, and leaderboards consistently across a global player base, while elastically scaling to handle unpredictable traffic spikes, has been crucial for delivering a seamless player experience\nIn retail and e-commerce, Spanner helps businesses manage the complexities of modern commerce. Walmart uses Spanner to modernize its inventory and payment management, providing a real-time, consistent view across online and physical stores. MercadoLibre, a global online marketplace and e-commerce provider, leverages Spanner to handle the global needs of their customers, including massive demand spikes during major product launches.\nLeaders in transportation, such as Uber, rely on Spanner to handle millions of concurrent users and billions of trips per month across over 10,000 cities and billions of database transactions per day.\nThese examples illustrate that for many modern applications, Spanner's specific blend of global consistency, massive scalability, high availability and interoperable multi-model isn't just a technical advantage; it's a fundamental enabler. Business models built around real-time global inventory, instantaneously consistent financial records, or seamless worldwide multiplayer experiences become significantly simpler, less risky, and more feasible to implement with Spanner.\nThe future with Spanner\nThe SIGMOD award recognizes the contributions of over 30 individuals, and countless other current and prior Googlers who have played roles throughout its development and evolution. It’s been a privilege to witness the journey from the initial ambitious concepts to the globally impactful system it is today. The journey from the original OSDI paper published to this 2025 SIGMOD Systems Award highlights over a decade of sustained research, engineering, and investment by Google. This long-term commitment is rare and is a key factor behind Spanner's enduring success and impact.\nThanks to you, our customers, Spanner remains a living system that continues to evolve, benefiting from ongoing improvements, driven by both internal use and the needs of our cloud customers. Looking ahead, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with distributed databases. We're excited about enabling new kinds of applications, including those leveraging AI, and continuing our mission to simplify the complexities of data management for developers building the next generation of world-changing applications.\nExperience the Spanner difference \nThe 2025 ACM SIGMOD Systems Award is a tremendous honor and a validation of the path we embarked on years ago. If you are at the  2025 SIGMOD conference, join us on Tuesday, June 24 at 4:30 pm to hear from and meet with the Google team. \nIf Spanner's capabilities for consistency, scale, and availability resonate with the challenges you face, we encourage you to learn more:\nExplore Spanner to learn about supported features and use cases, and get started with a 90-day Spanner free trial instance.\nDive deeper with documentation  \nFor the academically inclined, read the original and successor papers on Spanner  \nIn closing, we believe Spanner unlocks new possibilities for building reliable, scalable, and globally consistent applications, and we are excited to see what you, our customers, will build with it.",

    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-remote-mcp",
    "description": "Today, we’re announcing support for remote MCP servers in Claude Code. Connect your favorite tools and data sources to personalize your coding experience without needing to manage local servers.\nUsing Claude Code as your primary development interface\nClaude Code can access both tools and resources exposed by MCP servers, giving it the ability to pull context from your third-party services—such as dev tools, project management systems, and knowledge bases—and take actions within those services.\nYou can integrate Claude Code with any remote MCP server, and the growing ecosystem of servers means that new capabilities are constantly coming online.\nFor example, by integrating Claude Code with the Sentry MCP server, you can access errors and issues from Sentry. Then, you can debug using the context of those issues without leaving your terminal.\n\n\n\nYou can also integrate Claude Code with the Linear MCP server to work with the context of your active projects.\n“Linear's MCP integration brings Linear projects and issues directly into Claude Code,” shares Tom Moor, Head of Engineering at Linear. “With structured, real-time context from Linear, Claude Code can pull in issue details and project status—engineers can now stay in flow when moving between planning, writing code, and managing issues. Fewer tabs, less copy-paste. Better software, faster.”\n\n\n\nSeamless connections with minimal maintenance\nRemote MCP servers offer a lower maintenance alternative to local servers: just add the vendor’s URL to Claude Code—no manual setup required. Vendors handle updates, scaling, and availability, so you can focus on building instead of managing server infrastructure.\nClaude Code also features native OAuth support for remote MCP servers, ensuring secure connections to your existing accounts. Simply authenticate to your servers once, and Claude Code handles the rest—no API keys to manage or credentials to store.\nGetting started\nRemote MCP server support is available now in Claude Code. View the documentation to get started or explore our MCP directory with recommended servers.",

    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/product-release-announcements/now-in-public-preview-mongodb-for-intellij-plugin",
    "description": "The MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin empowers Java developers to build and ship applications quickly and confidently by enhancing the Database Explorer experience in the IntelliJ IDEA. After first announcing the plugin in private preview at .local London in the fall of 2024, we’ve partnered with our friends at JetBrains to release a new and improved experience in public preview. Using the MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin, developers can analyze their application code alongside their database, accelerating query development, validating accuracy, and highlighting anti-patterns with proactive performance insights.\nWhat’s in the MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin?\nAs part of the public preview, we’re committed to ensuring that the MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin not only meets developers' technical requirements but also paves the way for a seamless developer experience with MongoDB Atlas. The MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin Public Preview offers developers the following capabilities:\nField-level autocompletion for Java queries - Auto-suggests field names from MongoDB collections as developers write queries.\nSchema and type validation - Surfaces inline warnings when query values don’t match the expected field type based on the collection schema, and validates that a field exists in your collection’s schema.\nJava query execution in IntelliJ console - Allows developers to test Java queries with a single click without needing to switch tools or translate syntax.\nProactive anti-pattern detection - Identifies potential performance issues (such as a query missing an index) and provides inline warnings and documentation links.\nSpring and Java driver support - Supports query syntax across popular Java patterns, criteria API, and aggregation patterns.\nCode smarter with your AI - Plugin-generated linting insights help your in-IDE AI assistant detect and resolve code issues.\nFigure 1. Code smarter with your AI. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nBenefits of using the official MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin\nJava development often involves working with complex, evolving data models, making MongoDB’s flexible document model an ideal choice for Java applications' data layer. The plugin provides developers with a unified experience for building with MongoDB directly inside IntelliJ, enabling faster and more focused development.\nBy eliminating the need to switch between IntelliJ and external tools, the plugin streamlines query development and testing workflows. Features like field-level autocomplete and inline schema validation reduces errors before runtime, allowing developers to build and validate MongoDB queries with confidence and speed. Whether writing queries with the MongoDB Java driver, Spring Data, or aggregation pipelines, the plugin provides context-aware suggestions and real-time feedback that accelerate development.\nAdditionally, the plugin proactively flags common MongoDB query anti-patterns—such as missing indexes or inefficient operators—within your line of code, helping teams catch performance issues before they hit production. With the ability to test queries directly in the IntelliJ MongoDB console and view execution metadata like query plans and durations, the plugin brings performance awareness and code correctness to where developers actually write the code for their applications.\nHow to get started with the MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin\nYou can get started using the MongoDB for IntelliJ plugin through the JetBrains marketplace.\nQuestions? Feedback? Please post on our community forums or through UserVoice. We value your input as we continue to develop a compelling offering for the Java community.",

    "description": "What if you were to tell\nKubernetes Monitoring what you wanted, and the system configured collectors based on your choices? We wondered that as well—wondered enough to create\nAlloy Operator and its\nHelm chart for version 3.0 of the\nKubernetes Monitoring Helm chart. \nWe’re excited to share that the new Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart is now available, and it introduces a dynamic way of setting up your telemetry data collection with Alloy Operator. In this blog post we’ll take a look at why we made the change, and how it makes configuration and customizing for your needs better.\nWhy change?\nLet’s talk about why we created Alloy Operator in the first place:\nThe main values.yaml file of the Helm chart was humongous. In version 1.6, there were almost 3,000 lines of code. It was daunting to try to find the few lines of code you care about. Even in Version 2.0, 71% of the values file was\nGrafana Alloy fields. \nEach Alloy instance required a Helm subchart. Helm limits how subcharts are handled, meaning any modification you want to pass to the subchart’s values must be defined in the parent’s values.yaml file. And the values.yaml file does not “template” itself. Not only does it become a lot of code, but it’s code that some users will never need or use, depending on their configuration.\nWe had a new feature to introduce, which meant yet another Helm chart. On top of all that, new Alloy instances are looming in the future. \nDynamic ‘feature influence’\nThe Alloy Operator can also dynamically configure the traditional Alloy objects using the instructions from the Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart. When you select a feature you want to include, Alloy Operator configures the appropriate Alloy collector and its requirements. Requirements can be specific permissions, ports, environmental variables, and so on.\nFor example, if you enable the\nGrafana Cloud Application Observability feature, the alloy-receiver instance will automatically have its ports opened to the matching receiver.\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n# Set by you:\napplicationObservability:\nenabled: true\nreceivers:\nzipkin:\nenabled: true\nport: 9411\n# Automatically set by the Alloy Operator:\nalloy-receiver:\nalloy:\nextraPorts:\n- name: zipkin\nport: 9411\ntargetPort: 9411\nprotocol: TCP\nWe have plans for even more places where enabling and configuring features will automatically configure your Alloy instances.\nTail sampling now available\nWe’re proud to announce that in version 3.0,\n tail sampling is now as easy as enabling it within your otlp-type destinations. Prior to 3.0, this required configuring complex interactions between the Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart and at least one or more additional Alloy instances. Tail sampling allows for traces to be “sampled” using various policies. Common options include filtering based on a percentage, status codes, or span attributes. Tail sampling is enabled under destinations:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\ndestinations:\n- name: tempo\ntype: otlp\nurl: tempo.tempo.svc:4317\ntraces: {enabled: true}\nprocessors:\ntailSampling:\nenabled: true\nThis will automatically deploy the extra Alloy instances required to properly apply your tail sampling policies, before delivering to your original intended destination. This dynamic deployment of Alloy was not possible without the Alloy Operator.\nHow Alloy Operator works\nAlloy Operator is a Helm-based, small-footprint operator created using the\nOperator SDK. Instead of requiring an Alloy instance and a Helm chart, Alloy Operator acts on kind: Alloy objects. When an Alloy object is deployed to the cluster by the Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart, the Alloy Operator:\nCreates the components needed by the object (such as file system access, permissions, or the capability to read secrets)\nPerforms a Helm install of the Alloy object and its components\nTo view what’s been installed, you can use the Helm list command. This diagram shows all available Alloy objects installed as of 3.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelm chart 3.0: same best practices as before\nHelm chart 3.0 follows the same best practices as previous versions, and ensures\nencapsulation to maintain modularity and security. That means each object, whether Alloy, Node Exporter, or cAdvisor, is restricted to the permissions required for it to perform its function.\nUpgrading from Helm chart v1\nEven with all these changes, we’re doing what we can to make migration as simple as possible. Most of v1’s settings will map directly to a setting in v2. Plus, you can reference the\nmigration guide to help show how to do that. We are also building a\nmigration utility that should be able to take your v1 values.yaml file and return a valid v3 values.yaml file.\nUpgrading from Helm chart v2.x\nAlloy Operator requires the use of the new Alloy CRD, which will only be applied on new installations. With upgrades, you must first deploy the CRD. The Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart will detect if the CRD is required and will print the location of the CRD for install. Alternatively, you can download the CRD manifest from the\nAlloy Operator releases, and apply it with kubectl.\nFeedback\nWe love to hear from you! All of the changes to the\nKubernetes Monitoring Helm chart and the creation of Alloy Operator were inspired by the feedback and comments we have heard from our amazing community. If you are using the Helm chart, tell us what you think. We drive development on feedback and contributions. Find us in the Grafana public Slack in the #kubernetes channel, or attend one of our\nk8s-monitoring Helm chart office hours.\n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case.\n Sign up for free now!",

    "title": "Introducing Kingfisher: Real-Time Secret Detection and Validation",
    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/product-release-announcements/introducing-kingfisher-real-time-secret-detection-validation",
    "description": "Foreword from Kingfisher’s developer\nAs a Staff Security Engineer at MongoDB, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to further harden the environments that our customers rely on to protect their data. Central to that is detecting and managing exposed secrets before they turn into security risks. My role involves using an array of tools, from static code analyzers1 to secrets managers.2 However, I have never been fully satisfied with the tools at my disposal. Frustrated by the performance issues, limited flexibility, and high false positive rates of existing open source secret scanners, I started building my own tool in July 2024. Ten months later, that project became Kingfisher, an open-source secret scanner that goes beyond detection. It also verifies the validity of the secrets it detects.\nWhat began as a pet project has grown into a core component of MongoDB’s internal security workflows. Kingfisher now helps MongoDB’s engineering teams rapidly scan and verify secrets across Git repositories, directories, and more. Kingfisher, along with moving to short-term credentials, is our answer to the growing challenges of stolen credentials and credential-stuffing attacks. I am happy to announce that we are now releasing Kingfisher to the broader community so all developers and security teams can benefit from it. And by releasing Kingfisher as open source, we’re continuing a tradition that goes back to MongoDB’s roots—empowering developers through open, accessible tools.\nWhat is Kingfisher?\nKingfisher is a high-performance, open-source secret scanning tool that combs through code repositories, Git commit histories, and file systems. Kingfisher performs this to rapidly uncover hard-coded credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data. It can be used seamlessly across GitHub and GitLab repositories, both remote and local, as well as files and directories on disk, helping security teams quickly catch exposed secrets wherever they live. However, Kingfisher goes a step beyond traditional secret scanners.\nMost tools simply flag anything that may look like a secret, which means engineers need to sift through false positives. Kingfisher is different. It actively validates the secrets it detects by testing them against external systems, such as the relevant cloud services or API endpoints. This dynamic approach helps identify which secrets are truly active and, thus, high-risk.\nFigure 1. An example of an active AWS secret access key detected and validated by Kingfisher.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 2. An example of an inactive Slack app token discovered and validated by Kingfisher. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 3. An example scan summary produced by Kingfisher showing one active secret and four inactive secrets detected. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nKingfisher is designed for on-premises use, running entirely within the user’s own infrastructure. As a result, discovered secrets never leave the environment or pass through a third-party service. This ensures that developers and security teams retain full control over sensitive data without inheriting a third party’s security posture or introducing yet another external store of credentials. Kingfisher is also cloud-agnostic: It verifies credentials from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and any other platform in use. Unlike cloud provider-specific tools that overlook cross-cloud risks, Kingfisher supports security teams’ unified visibility and control, no matter where secrets live.\nBuilt with both performance and security in mind, Kingfisher combines extremely fast pattern matching, source code parsing, entropy analysis, and real-time validation. This all reduces noise to surface only what actually matters. It is designed for practical, real-world use, whether scanning a single repo or integrating it into a larger CI/CD pipeline.\nWhy MongoDB built Kingfisher\nThe threat landscape is constantly evolving, and credential-related attacks are on the rise. Stolen credentials are frequently sold on underground markets. Attackers use automated tools to launch credential-stuffing attacks that can lead to unauthorized access and serious data breaches. Traditional secret-scanning tools have not kept up. Such tools often flood teams with false positives, are slow to run, and do not confirm whether a detected secret remains active or dangerous. This means developers and security teams waste time and effort chasing down dead ends while missing actual threats.\nKingfisher was built to solve this challenge. It is fast, lightweight, and designed to detect exposed secrets. It then validates them in real time by checking whether the secret remains active. By cutting through the noise and focusing on active risks, Kingfisher enables teams to respond faster and protect systems effectively.\nKingfisher also helps security teams progress toward higher Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) compliance. It does this by supporting secure configuration management through proactive detection and verification of exposed secrets across codebases and repositories. At the foundational level, it supports SLSA’s core requirement of preventing secrets from being embedded in source code. This is one of the most common and critical vulnerabilities in the software supply chain. For organizations targeting SLSA Levels 2 and above, Kingfisher also helps strengthen source code integrity by reducing the risk of malicious or accidental secret exposure, which could compromise the trustworthiness of builds. Secure configuration management is a critical part of achieving higher SLSA levels. Kingfisher helps teams adopt these best practices by helping keep secrets out of source code and managing them securely throughout the development lifecycle.\nFigure 4. Runtime chart comparing Kingfisher with two other popular open-source secrets scanning tools.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe runtime chart above presents the results of internal testing conducted by MongoDB engineers. It compares Kingfisher against two other popular open-source secret scanning tools: TruffleHog and GitLeaks. In this comparison, lower runtime values indicate superior performance. This underscores Kingfisher’s balance of speed and robust, real-time secret validation.\nHow Kingfisher works\nKingfisher is built in Rust, which was chosen for its speed, safety, and concurrency capabilities. Initially inspired by and built on top of a forked version of the Apache 2 licensed \"Nosey Parker\" code, Kingfisher re-engineers and extends its foundation with modern, high-performance technologies.\nKingfisher’s features include:\nFeature\n            Description\n        \nRust-powered performance\n\t\t\t\t\tWriting Kingfisher in Rust maximizes performance while providing memory safety. This makes it ideal for scanning large codebases without sacrificing reliability.\n        \nHigh-speed regex matching with Hyperscan\n            Kingfisher uses Hyperscan to handle complex and high-volume pattern matching. This engine delivers high-speed regular expression matching that enables real-time scanning on the largest code repositories.\n        \nMulti-language source parsing with Tree-sitter\n            Kingfisher employs Tree-sitter to parse source code accurately across 20+ programming languages. This enables Kingfisher to understand language-specific syntax, reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy.\n        \nEfficient scanning engine\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to its advanced parsing and regex capabilities, Kingfisher uses multi-threaded scanning to traverse files, commit histories, and binary blobs. Custom-built rules combine pattern matching with Shannon entropy checks3, flagging only high-confidence secret exposures.\n\t\t\t\nDynamic validation\n\t\t\t\tOnce a potential secret is detected, Kingfisher validates it by performing external checks. This includes testing database connectivity and calling cloud service APIs to confirm whether the secret is active and poses an immediate risk.\n\t\t\t\nExtensible rulesets\n\t\t\t\tKingfisher supports a rich set of rules defined in YAML files. These rules describe the patterns and metadata to look for. This includes confidence levels, examples, and dependency rules to provide nuanced secret detection and validation.\n\t\t\t\nIntegration ready\n\t\t\t\tKingfisher is designed to be easily integrated into automated CI/CD pipelines and be used in conjunction with GitHub’s secret scanning program. This enhances its role as part of a comprehensive security strategy.\n\t\t\t\nHow MongoDB uses Kingfisher internally\nAt MongoDB, Kingfisher plays a critical role in safeguarding code repositories and internal systems. As part of the company's comprehensive security strategy, Kingfisher is used across various stages of MongoDB’s development and deployment pipeline. This helps secure MongoDB’s codebase and complements our move away from long-lived secrets.\nBelow are four key ways Kingfisher is used at MongoDB:\nPre-commit scanning: MongoDB developers run Kingfisher locally to catch accidentally hard-coded secrets before they commit code.\nCI/CD integration: Kingfisher is integrated into MongoDB’s continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Thus, it automatically ensures that every build is scanned for potential secret exposure.\nHistorical code analysis: Kingfisher scans Git commit histories to identify and remediate legacy exposures in MongoDB’s code repositories.\nCloud and database validation: Kingfisher automatically tests whether a detected credential is still valid using its dynamic validation capabilities. This allows MongoDB engineers to take immediate action if a secret has been compromised.\nGet started with Kingfisher\nThe development—and now release—of Kingfisher represents a major leap forward in MongoDB’s approach to securing code and infrastructure. More than a tool, it embodies our ongoing commitment to contribute open-source solutions that empower organizations to protect their critical assets against evolving cyber threats.\nKingfisher builds on a solid foundation and introduces significant improvements. This includes:\nReal-time secret validation\nEnhanced accuracy with source code parsing with Tree-sitter,\nOver 700 rules for detecting and validating a broader range of secrets,\nCross-platform support for macOS, Linux, and Windows\nTo learn more about Kingfisher and start using it in your own workflows, visit our GitHub repository for detailed documentation and join the community discussions.\n1 Tools that examine source code without executing it to identify potential errors, vulnerabilities, or code quality issues.\n2 Tools used to securely store, manage, and access sensitive information like API keys, credentials, and tokens.\n3 A method of measuring randomness in a string, often used to identify high-entropy values like passwords or API keys that may indicate a secret.",

    "description": "本期「此话当真」的嘉宾是 ClackyAI 的 CEO 李亚飞。\n\n从搭博客那天起，李亚飞就把「懒，是推动人类进步的力量」当成自己的 Slogan。他敲了 20 年代码，曾是深信服成长最快的研发主管之一，也是 Ruby 深圳社区的早期组织者，在那里遇见了自己的第一个合伙人。 2021 年，真格基金在 Pre-A 阶段投资了 ClackyAI 公司至简天成。\n\n在李亚飞看来，AI 编程正从 L2（补全）走向 L3（理解和规划），再迈向 L4（完全自主）。L4 还早，L3 正当时。ClackyAI 就是一个为 L3 场景打造的云端开发环境（CDE），目标是让懂产品的人，也能通过 AI 构建出专业的代码成果。\n\n当 vibe coding 成为趋势，李亚飞预测程序员们将经历一次身份转换——从事无巨细写代码，到做判断、定方向的架构师。\n\nClackyAI 既能像 Devin 一样自动提 PR，也像 Cursor 提供引用和纠错。但更关键的是，它基于原生 Agent 架构，加上工程师可控的任务规划，让 AI 写出的代码刚刚好。\n\n在 ClackyAI 正式开放 beta 之际，我们和李亚飞聊了聊：它想解决什么问题？和现有工具有什么不同？什么是他心中真正的「make something people want」？当写代码的方式被改写，人与 AI 的协作会走向哪里？\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClackyAI，构建专业产品最好的起点\n\n01:15 ClackyAI 是一款云端 L3 级 Coding Studio\n01:38 一个好的名字就是成功的一半，「Clacky」取的是敲键盘的声音\n02:14 AI 编程的 L3 阶段：人与 AI 各占一半的交互状态\n04:11 ClackyAI 能做到什么？如何帮助用户从 0 到 10 构建产品？\n\n懒，是推动人类进步的力量\n\n07:08 如何理解「懒，是推动人类进步的力量」？\n08:21 目标是让懂产品的用户也能做出专业代码成果\n10:28 Vibe coding 实现程序员身份转换：从事无巨细写代码，到成为系统架构师\n12:38 人机协作方式的终局：形成一条软件开发的流水线\n\n打造一款云端编程的 Agent 产品\n\n14:13 为什么选择今天做 ClackyAI？编码是上云最后的关键一环\n15:31 云端编程技术的应用场景探索，Agent 兴起带来拐点\n16:29 AI 会越来越多介入代码，为 AI 打造一个云端的原生开发环境至关重要\n17:09 AI 自动搭建开发环境，全球还仅此一家\n\n创业源自于一个非共识的洞察\n\n19:03 创业不变的本质是「make something people want」\n19:56 创业要回归第一性原理，源于一个非共识的洞察\n20:44 发挥人类需求的核心：个性化需求远远未被释放，未来会迎来爆发式增长\n22:00 AI coding 市场并非赢家通吃，应用层产品会百花齐放\n22:37 人与 AI 协同的背景下，AI CDE 将会成为新的共识\n23:54 如何考虑迁移成本？循序渐进，先解决 build 的问题\n25:37 ClackyAI 的未来：终局是一个「软件工厂」\n27:01 发展中的「护城河」：为 AI 为生的云端开发环境 → 数据飞轮与品牌优势 → 高效、全链路的解决方案\n\n未来不要害怕代码，要相信\n\n27:39 从小对计算机原理的好奇，驱动创业中对长期价值的追求\n29:01 真正长期的价值不是讲一个漂亮的故事\n30:48 目前用 AI 编程更好的往往是专业的产品中\n34:37 给年轻创业者的建议：干中学，学中干，不断滚动自己的能力认知开发者，而非初学者\n32:02 「AI First」 已经是团队内部默认的节奏\n34:06 将思考沉淀在产品中、沉淀在公司\n\n\n\n监制：Xin、Cindy、Neya\n后期：Yanaego\n\n\n\n《此话当真》是一档由真格基金出品的泛商业类播客，真格基金投资团队将在此和各领域的领军人物一起分享最新热点和行业洞察。\n\n真格基金创立于 2011 年，是国内最早的天使投资机构之一。自创立伊始，真格基金一直积极在人工智能、芯片与半导体、机器人与硬件、医疗健康、企业服务、新能源、跨境出海、消费生活等领域寻找最优秀的创业团队和引领时代的投资机会。\n\n真格，你的创业第一站!",

    "description": "In Grafana Cloud, we offer a range of AI capabilities to support your observability needs, including a feature for forecasting on any of your metrics and coupling it with\nGrafana Alerting. This is critical functionality if you want to make the switch from reactive to proactive alerting, as troubleshooting a problem before it arises is an important part of modern observability.\nFor our\nforecasting capabilities, we’re excited to announce a new and improved user interface designed to make exploring and fine-tuning forecasts faster, easier, and more intuitive than ever.You don’t have to go through several pages, settings, and optimizations anymore; we’ve streamlined the entire process.\nWith the new UI, testing your data for forecastability is easier than ever. You’ll see a live preview of the forecast right in your browser, letting you instantly assess how well the model fits your time series. If you think you can improve the model fit, you can now tweak model parameters in real time and see the impact instantly. No more guesswork—just immediate visual feedback.\nForecasting and adaptive alerting\nForecasting supports an observability method called adaptive alerting: Before a problem arises, an alert is triggered to catch the problem so it doesn’t manifest. \nFor example, let’s say you run a local e-commerce company that tracks its transactions and you want to have a better sense for your future needs. Of course, your transactions vary naturally. You might have more orders on the weekend than on weekdays. Or maybe you have more transactions during evenings than during working hours. By setting up a forecast on the transactions metric, you’ll fit this transaction behavior. \nAnd when you combine this with alerts, you’ll know when a metric goes out of bounds instead of tuning static alerts, helping to ensure you’re on top of your transactions before you run into a situation where you can’t handle them due to a sudden surge. This is especially powerful when used in conjunction with our\ndaily and weekly seasonality modes and inclusion of holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we improved metrics forecasting in Grafana Cloud\nIn order to support this new behavior, we have made some significant technical improvements by separating how we actually run forecasts in Grafana Cloud. (If you don’t have one already, you can\nsign up for a forever-free account today!)\nPreviously, we sent data and parameters into the backend, ran a model, and sent it back to the frontend so that it can be reviewed by the users. By putting the forecasting creation and tuning step into the frontend, it’s now possible to complete this step faster than ever. This is supported by the\naugurs library. Augurs does the heavy lifting in the frontend in the customization stage. After that’s done, the forecast is sent into the backend to be available 24/7.\nHow to setup an adaptive alert using forecasting\nLearn how you can setup a forecast in this video:\n {\nresponded = true;\nresponse && response.status === 200 ? vimeo_is_up = true : vimeo_is_up = false;\n})\n.catch(error => {\nresponded = true;\n})\"\nx-cloak>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s supposed to be a video here, but for some reason there isn’t. Either we entered the id wrong (oops!), or Vimeo is down. If it’s the latter, we’d expect they’ll be back up and running soon. In the meantime,\ncheck out our blog!\nYou can also follow this step-by-step tutorial:\nIn Grafana Cloud, navigate to Metrics Forecast.\nChoose a metric to create a forecast from. We support the following data sources for forecasting: Prometheus, Graphite, Grafana Loki (metric queries only), Postgres, InfluxDB, Snowflake, Splunk, Elasticsearch, BigQuery, MongoDB, and Datadog.\nUse our instantaneous preview to tune your model. Also use our advanced model options if you think that the shown forecast isn’t good enough.\nWhen you’re done with tuning, give your forecast a name and check the box below it to also create an alert based on it. For names, we recommend that you follow your internal naming conventions to make sure that you find your forecasts more easily.\nNow you can click on Create forecast. Your forecast is now trained in the backend and available 24/7 to give you an adaptive alert.\nFAQs on adaptive alerting\nNow, maybe you read this entire blog, but you’re still unsure what we actually mean by adaptive alerting. Let’s take a look at this concept and its advantages in detail. \nWhen should I use adaptive alerting?\nAdaptive alerts are best suited to identify unexpected changes in human-derived usage patterns. These patterns will have daily ups and downs—people behave differently at work versus then at home or at rest. There are also weekly patterns—people behave differently on weekends as opposed to weekdays. \nThese patterns are evident in data such as the rate of sales transactions, or amount of traffic to a website (and system load that induces), but also in telemetry data of machinery in a factory or phone calls to a support hotline. \nAdaptive alerts can identify partial failures in a way static alerts are unable to. For example, adaptive alerts can identify a sudden 20% drop in sales transactions due to a struggling payment vendor, a peculiar increase in traffic to a seldom-used API, or an unusual temperature rise in a machine during normal operation. These issues may not be immediately catastrophic, but the adaptive alert firing allows you to learn of the issue sooner and maybe even avoid a potential major problem.\nWhat are the advantages of adaptive alerting?\nAdaptive alerts are great at tracking unexpected changes in human-derived usage patterns, as mentioned above, but they also continuously learn and adapt to changes in that behavior.\nConsider the example of a web service with a growing user base and how to detect a possible denial-of-service attack. A static threshold alert can accomplish this in the short term, but as the user base grows, so does the traffic. Having to continually increase the static threshold is bothersome and error-prone. An adaptive alert will recognize the growing traffic pattern and only alert on a dramatic rise in requests.\nAdaptive alerts can also give special treatment to calendar days using the holidays feature, so expected drops or increases in your data on national holidays or other specified periods are accounted for and do not alert you unnecessarily.\nWhat does adaptive alerting cost?\nMetrics forecasting is now available in Grafana Cloud free of charge! If you are an Advanced or Enterprise customer, you can just start using it at no upcharge.\nThere are\nsome usage limits, but talk to us about requesting limit increases.\n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case.\n Sign up for free now!",

    "title": "Prometheus data source update: Redefining our big tent philosophy",
    "url": "https://grafana.com/blog/2025/06/16/prometheus-data-source-update-redefining-our-big-tent-philosophy/",
    "description": "Note: This blog post was originally published on Aug. 6, 2024. It has been updated to reflect changes to our Prometheus support for Microsoft Azure and to our roadmap.\n\nAs we continue adding to our growing catalog of more than 100 plugins for Grafana, we have been focused on developing data sources for Grafana that are more purpose-built for the respective technologies.\nAn example of this has been how we’ve updated our core Prometheus data source. Last year we deprecated AWS authentication from the original Prometheus data source, and we created a new dedicated\n Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus plugin that specifically catered to the AWS use case. If you are a Grafana user who uses Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP), you can learn more about how to install or migrate to the new plugin in\n our Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus documentation.\nMore recently, we deprecated Microsoft Azure authentication from the original Prometheus data source in Grafana 12, and we built a new dedicated\nAzure Monitor Managed Service for Prometheus plugin that specifically caters to Azure use cases. Users can now connect to Azure Monitor Managed Prometheus data source using\nAzure’s current user authentication. You can learn more about installing and migrating to the new plugin in our\nAzure Monitor Managed Service for Prometheus documentation. \nAnd we will continue to explore how to make other data sources in the Grafana ecosystem more purpose-built over time.\nA bigger ‘big tent’\nThis refined focus on our data sources is a reflection of our commitment to meet our users where they are.\nObservability today is a complicated space. Companies of all sizes have adopted numerous open source and commercial tools to monitor an ever expanding sprawl of infrastructure, applications, and even physical devices. In our recent\n third annual Observability Survey, the average user said they have 16 data sources configured in Grafana, with companies with more than 5,000 employees averaging 24.\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone reading this, that this explosion in observability tools has been a pretty great wave for Grafana Labs to ride thanks to our commitment to our “big tent” philosophy. We believe that organizations should own their observability strategy, have the freedom to choose their own tools, and have the ability to bring all their data together in one view, no matter where it lives. As a result, Grafana has quickly become the de facto visualization tool for centralized observability.\nBut over the years, we have evolved our understanding of what “big tent” stands for. While we still prioritize software interoperability, “big tent” also means surfacing the meaningful differences between data sources so users can form clear expectations and avoid solving for the lowest common denominator. These differences are in the values of each upstream project as much as they are in APIs.\nIn our opinion, data sources with open source and foundation-run projects should be exclusively compatible with the upstream APIs and reflect the project’s vendor neutrality. Vendors adjacent to these open source projects, with their own API and differences, are also invited into the big tent: You can build data sources that are tailored to your specific technology and still reach the Grafana community. (Potential partners can inquire about working directly with us on commercial data source publishing options at\nintegrations@grafana.com.) But whether it comes from a commercial partner or the community, we believe that each data source should have a clear purpose and lean into that goal.\nPrometheus is a standout example. Throughout a decade of development, this open source project has grown into a gold standard for time series metrics data and is critical infrastructure for businesses across the industry. It remains a vibrant and independent project under the governance of the\n Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), with countless open source contributors continuing to evolve the code to support challenges, and a thriving community providing a colossal support apparatus.\nUsers of our core Prometheus data source should expect this data source to closely mirror the functionality developed and supported within this community. The data source itself should not be overcomplicated or otherwise confuse users with proprietary functionality that branches off of the Prometheus project.\nMeanwhile, the proprietary projects in Prometheus’s orbit should be built and welcomed into the community as separate data sources. This is why we have provided Grafana users who use Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP) with access to the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus plugin, which supports platform-specific AWS Signature Version 4 authentication.\nThat’s also why we encourage users of Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus to use the Azure Monitor Managed Service for Prometheus Data Source, which supports Azure authentication methods (e.g., app registration, managed identity, etc.).\nWhat’s next\nWe feel this “big tent” approach has been a natural evolution we’ve seen in the industry as we continue to field requests for new data sources that span a wide range of licensing models and that support every flavor of platform-specific auth, query language, feature, and more.\nBut interoperability continues to be one of the primary drivers of our roadmap. We maintain\n 100+ plugins for Grafana and\n 100+ Grafana Cloud integrations for monitoring third-party tools. Our open source projects, including the core technology behind the Grafana LGTM Stack (\n Loki for logs,\n Grafana for visualization,\n Tempo for traces, and\n Mimir for metrics), are built on “big tent” principles. We also contribute to OSS projects such as Prometheus (we are the No. 1 company contributor) and OpenTelemetry, with a focus on making the\n two projects more interoperable.\nWhile this is our current thinking on “big tent” and interoperability, we want to continue to listen to our community, partners, and users to better refine our approach. Please reach out to the team at\nintegrations@grafana.com if you have any feedback, questions, or concerns.\nWe’ve also created a\npublic roadmap that shows all of the date source plugins being built by Grafana Labs, our partners, and our community. Grafana Cloud users can now see our current plans and request new plugins, upvote existing requests, or comment with ideas and requirements.\nNo matter how you engage with our community, we want to hear from you and learn how we can make Grafana’s “big tent” bigger and better.",

    "description": "两天前（2025.6.11），创立 10 年的影石Insta 360 在 A 股科创板上市了。\n\n创始人刘靖康生于1991年，是科创板史上首位90后董事长。四年前，他在上交所上会时，才刚刚29岁。截至目前，影石市值超过700亿，总计募资额19.38亿，在 2025 年A股市场的募资总额中排名第三，成为最受投资者看好的企业之一。\n\n这并不难理解。过去十年，影石凭借影像类的产品创新，迅速成为全景相机全球第一、运动相机全球第二。作为一家初创公司在全景赛道内迅速战胜了老牌世界巨头 GoPro，并在运动相机的市场里不断缩小二者的差距。成为中国硬件创业赛道中，成长速度最快、也最受瞩目的公司之一。\n\n从2022年开始，我在不同时期和创始人刘靖康进行了多次对话。\n\nJK 是我在职业生涯中遇到过的，最有个性的创业者之一。2022 年，我第一次见到他，就发现了他在商业上的巨大野心。在影石当年的产品规划里，就有三个世界级的、完全原创性的秘密目标。你能感受到这位中国90后新锐的雄心勃勃。但同时，这也是一位性情中人，会坦诚地分享自己的失误、局限和种种态度，甚至负面情绪，在企业家中，这样程度的自我暴露非常少见。\n\n也令JK显得过目难忘。\n\n在影石高速成长、也遇到高度挑战的这三年间，也是中国创投界和全球局势风云变幻的三年。有关这个纵深的观察，我在公众号上发布了一篇关于 JK 的特写及访谈实录👉《影石敲钟，一群90后眼中的世界级公司｜与刘靖康复盘创业十年》。欢迎前往阅读。\n\n这期播客的访谈包含两次录制：\n\n第一次，是在2024年8月，影石连年翻倍增长，但正面临与新对手大疆的正面竞争。\n\n第二次，是在2025年6月，影石上市之际，应JK的邀请，我飞去深圳就最新动态进行更新。\n\n两次访谈对照，非常生动而细致地呈现了一位90后中国创业者在面对世界级竞争时的心理变化。\n\n本期嘉宾：刘靖康 （影石Insta360 创始人兼董事长 ，英文名JK）\n\n本期Shownotes：\n\n一、2024年8月，和JK的第一次访谈\n\n\n\nPart 1. 刘靖康其人：用保护色笼罩自己，也没什么意思\n\n04:04 两年不见，又到中秋，影石的秘密：居然一个老板在带头做礼盒？\n\n06:44 「还有什么事情是让你的CEO很难受的？」\n\n07:54 办公室里Hello Kitty 的面板上写了「冷静」\n\n09:24 今天身上背负许多责任，但我还是想保持真实的自己\n\n14:51 非常感谢两年前的访谈，两年来我一直在保持这个状态\n\n15:53 日语有个词叫「瓦嘎妈妈」\n\nPart 2.谈大疆：与巨头直面竞争意味着什么？\n\n16:33「为什么今天穿着大疆的文化衫来？」我还背GoPro的包呢\n\n17:17 遇到困难时我就看GoPro的宣传片，看完热血沸腾\n\n17:37 我在Twitter上发过：I love GoPro ，I love Nick Woodman\n\n17:56 怎么看大疆发动价格策略竞争？产品做不到独特的竞争力，就会选择价格\n\n20:13 创业公司就该遭遇巨头、迎击巨头\n\n23:35 GoPro 离我们上万公里，大疆离我们只有10公里\n\n25:06 流水不争先，争滔滔不绝\n\n26:37 大疆可能还真是独一档的对手，是补齐我们短板的最好教练\n\n27:42 硬件如何从源头降本：那些大疆教会我的事\n\n30:04 当你系统性地理解一家公司：有些是差距，有些是差异\n\n30:44 我们今天最大的不幸是赛道上有个大疆，最大的幸运也是赛道上有个大疆\n\n33:30 所谓代际选手：我比大疆的老板年轻十岁，压力也没那么大\n\n34:38 你今天是90后里最厉害的，不意味着你不会被80后干趴下？\n\n36:53 如果能用创新和效率打败巨头，会给很多人以启发\n\n38:16 再投胎也不一定有挑战大疆的机会\n\n38:32 我觉得汪滔也没遇过我这种对手\n\nPart 3. 挑战巨头，勇气从哪来？\n\n业务的选择与扩张：\n\n40:16 砍掉几千万的项目背后的计算\n\n41:16 如何选择做什么、不做什么；该坚持还是该放弃？\n\n44:15 我的桌上一直放着一架GoPro Karma，提醒自己不要着急\n\n45:26 坊间传闻，汪老板砍过的项目数不胜数\n\n对今日营商环境的理解：\n\n46:32 我发明了一个词，叫资本的囚徒困境\n\n48:20 赛道过度繁荣是效率低下的表现，但它符合人性\n\n49:09 恶性竞争：行业里的二选一、商业间谍——如果今天不放弃底线，我还有没有办法往前走一步？\n\n50:11 请大家放下工作去看彩虹\n\n51:11 注意力放哪，决定了你会成为一个什么样的人\n\n52:44 商业道德的自选规则：大部分公司失败并非因为对手的强大\n\n54:30 希望创造的规则：大家只需把注意力放在终点\n\n九岁的影石，怎么升级？\n\na）技术、机遇与优势：\n\n55:42 很难在这个场合讲自己的优势，你可以去采访一下我们的竞争对手\n\n56:59 我们公司还是有很多底牌，先不展开，只给你举几个例子\n\n57:39 哪些全景相机的能力积累能应用于新业务？软件护城河是否很低？\n\n01:00:03 大模型就像天上掉下一把加特林\n\nb）组织如何升级：\n\n01:00:23 如何在高速上边开车边换轮胎？\n\n01:01:08 面对强敌，首先解决员工信心的问题\n\n01:02:26 「你是公司最大的产品经理，这怎么解？」A级人才喜欢找招A级人，B级人才喜欢招C级人\n\n01:05:04 为什么字节良将如潮：context，not control（信息透明，充分授权）\n\n01:07:05 学华为IPD改革：太多人被华为巨大成功所迷惑，其实容易学得四不像\n\n01:10:30 动组织架构很危险，有可能会动到大动脉，哈哈哈\n\nc）我们想做百年老店\n\n01:13:47 在那些公司的历史墙前，我们被震撼\n\n01:15:25 长青基业学索尼：索尼傻傻的，挺可爱的\n\n01:17:34 伟大的公司不是靠把别人打败，靠做世界级的产品，靠创造市场\n\n01:19:45 没索尼的财力，学索尼的任性，会不会自找苦吃？\n\n01:20:17 这种好事凭什么轮到我们？找个魔鬼训练自己也不是坏事\n\n01:21:13 CEO 有自己的角色，创始人有特权能表达真实的自己\n\n二、2025年6月（影石上市后），与 JK 的对话\n\n（影石上市当天，使用自己的全景相机敲钟。图为相机拍摄下的现场画面。）\n\n影石敲钟，科创板首位90后登陆：\n\n01:22:04 等待五年终于上市：很奇怪，我一点感觉也没有\n\n01:24:20 「科创板史上首位90后？」寒武纪创始人上市时33岁…四年前上会时我29岁\n\n01:26:07 「最近有人在炒影石的概念股？」不要被割韭菜了😐\n\n01:26:50  买股票就像给那家公司写情书\n\n01:29:45 可能是史上第一位上市期间提醒投资者谨慎的董事长\n\n01:30:03 我没有股票账户，也没有理财记录\n\n01:50:26 什么是智能影像：侧重创造市场、依赖软件和AI\n\n复盘影石走过的10年：\n\n01:32:43 四大红利：万众创新、Youtube 崛起、供应链红利、跨境基建\n\n01:34:45 十年来最具挑战的时刻：大的风暴也是一场大考\n\n01:35:28 AcePro 2 卖断货、搞饥饿营销？背后是一个逆风翻盘的故事\n\n01:37:14 董事长犯大错怎么办？过几年我会把这些写进公司的历史墙…\n\n01:38:54 我改良了一个小游戏，时间允许的话我讲一下怎么玩…\n\n近两年，人才观的变化\n\n01:43:47 人才管理的复杂度远超我想象，价值也远超我想象\n\n01:44:51 一克拉钻石售价1万美金，10克拉钻石售价100万美金\n\n01:45:22 人才的两种稀缺性：敢于轮岗的公司对人和业务的理解都到了一定深度\n\n01:46:46 顶级人才最终都会出去创业，怎么解？\n\n影石真正的机遇和挑战是什么：\n\n01:51:41 一年来的心境变化：战术上积极，战略上要升维\n\n01:52:09 「手机以外的相机行业」，影石都将迎来大面积竞争\n\n01:54:23 中国商业史上最鼓舞人的是字节和Deepseek ，是典型的以小胜大\n\n01:55:45 上半年 agent 对我启发最大：值得重新思考交互方式\n\n01:56:51 我们为什么没有 AI 焦虑？\n\n01:57:39 剪映有机会做的很棒，但它不会覆盖掉我们\n\n01:59:20 影石X5发布，纽约中央车站大排长龙？——5 代积累的品牌价值，以及线下的力量\n\n如何深入理解影石这家公司？\n\n02:01:32 营收占比七成在海外？国内是练兵场，海外是粮仓\n\n02:03:51 中国企业已经是世界一流的企业，但目前仅限外显竞争层面\n\n02:04:22 next level 的企业竞争什么？\n\n02:12:08 过去一年，自己好像比GoPro厉害，但大疆也厉害\n\n02:14:01 小巨头和大巨头的竞争？不，我们是大头，因为头很大[doge]\n\n02:15:22 庆幸影像是个开放世界，开放世界是创新成长型公司的舞台\n\n02:17:22 影像界大疆？影石和大疆的本质区别是什么？\n\n02:17:52 员工发展第一，客户价值第二，股东回报第三\n\n02:20:23 多年保持13%+的高研发投入，「上市之后我们不会改变」\n\n02:22:54 募资总计19.38亿元，会往全栈上游去建设\n\n02:23:52 何时才能创造出新市场？on the way了，也都在我们的招股书上了\n\n02:29:39 乔布斯说连点成线，JK一楼走来，最关键的三个 dot\n\n02:32:36 如何对抗「怕失去」？因为 You Only Live Once！\n\n02:34:33 造产品 or 成功企业家？就像打游戏和做卷子，肯定打游戏快乐啊！\n\n02:17:37 乔布斯30岁被自己的公司开除，你30岁上市，人生会不会太顺了？\n\n02:39:05 做错一件事的损失VS没做一件事带来的机会损失，证明前者要比证明后者容易得多\n\n02:41:47 下一个十年，要怎样 think bold（始于敢想）？\n\n02:42:41 两个非常大胆的决定\n\n02:43:47 做一个 think bold 的公司是挺 think bold 的…\n\n02:43:47 如果你的想法是对的，只因和他人不同而从众，我不能接受…\n\n加听友群👇\n\n有关主理人：卫诗婕，独立商业作者，曾任《极客公园》执行总编，早年任职于《人物》、GQ报道、字节跳动。代表作：《ofo的终场战事》、《罗永浩：薛定谔的理想主义》、《朱一旦的枯燥生活》、《中东社交十年风云：金矿、折戟、浪潮再起》、《下一站，沙特》等。作品曾获虎嗅2024年度作者、金字节奖年度新锐作者、网易非虚构文学奖年度作者、全球真实故事奖中文报道十佳。\n\n有关「商业漫谈」：这是一档关注科技、商业、人文的深度访谈节目，致力于记录时代的商业史。聚焦商业趋势、伦理、竞争、价值。",

    "description": "🏰 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活。我是雨白。\n\n今天这期小酒馆，我想介绍一个特别有趣的朋友给你认识——王汉洋。汉洋不是典型意义上的「成功人士」。大二退学，从没上过一天班；做过 AI 创业者，无人机自动驾驶，也给各家媒体写过很多文章；做播客、拍古建筑、去俄罗斯种大豆，就在我们录制的十个小时前，他还在塞尔维亚给当地的古建筑做建模存档。\n\n我最初注意到他，是他在播客里讲一个在非洲建发电站的故事——那种叙述方式太有画面感了。我当时就在评论区留言说：这期节目完全可以变成电影剧本。后来在理想国的一次对谈，我们聊得更深，我才意识到：他不只是能讲故事的人，而是真的把很多事情，亲手做出来、理清楚了。而且他现在在做的事情特别有意思，他和合伙人们在全世界到处跑，给古建筑拍照，用AI来建档。\n\n他对于 AI 时代的创作，有很多反直觉的暴论。让我觉得无论如何，都得拉他来小酒馆聊聊。\n\n这一期节目，我们从他的经历开始，聊到 AI 时代的创作者如何自处，但聊着聊着就发现，这其实是一期关于「现实世界」的节目。我们常说 AI 会不会替代创作者、怎么才能不被AI取代，但汉洋说，也许我们真正忽略的，是这个世界本身。互联网上的信息其实还远远不够，它记录下的，只是现实的一小部分。而这个「缺口」，就是我们的机会。\n\n这期节目，或许能在 AI 时代给你一个不一样的视角，希望你会喜欢。\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n王汉洋：《山有虎》与《蜉蝣天地》的主播，世界级街（gāi）溜子。\n\n🪁 时间轴\n\n03:20 大二辍学搞 AI 创业，但并没有成为下一个乔布斯：「这事我占80%责任，大环境占20%」\n\n08:14  「我的人生原则就是必须住在五环外」\n\n15:05  自从我意识到上学和学习是两件事后，我就对上学没兴趣了\n\n22:44  在值得去做的事上死磕，与值得交往的朋友碰撞自我\n\n27:31  给全世界的建筑建模：跟随互联网一起成长的我们，会天然认为它储存了一切，但实际情况可能恰恰相反\n\n30:23  将信息从真实世界「走私」到数字世界：一个知识如果不能（在互联网上）被访问到，那就等同于它不存在\n\n35:15  未来只有 2 种内容创作：从 0 到 1，从 1 到无穷\n\n38:40  一句可能招人恨的暴论：如果有人认为 AI 会取代创作者，那 ta 可能没做过什么真正的好东西\n\n46:04 这是一个温吞水的时代：过往制度性的承诺没有了，但新的摧枯拉朽的变革又还未发生\n\n54:46 我做的所有事，其实都是这一件事：从真实世界挖掘、出土信息\n\n57:40  「别在心里怄太久」：当你对一件事的了解超过了你对它的兴趣，你就做不了这事了\n\n✏️ 猜你想看\n\n02:08 播客单集：《想要发电，要先有电：一个总工在中国和非洲修水电站的故事》\n\n21:33 汉洋写的关于 Temu 的稿子：《电商的美国游戏，靠卷赢不了》\n\n21:59 此处提及的另一篇稿子：《美国新梦：难以回流的制造业》\n\n27:31  汉洋和伙伴从去年 5 月开始做的建筑建模项目 Funes：funes.world\n\n\n\n\n\n32:14  相关文章：《ChatGPT 的挑战是网上没有足够多的信息 a.k.a. 互联网搁浅的地方》\n\n34:31 播客：《梁柱之间 · 山西》\n\n45:46 人物：阑夕，善于对互联网事件进行解读，被网友们称为「阑心一言」。\n\n47:31 近日，有网友在一篇需要付费购买的《2023-2028年中国煤炭行业竞争格局及发展趋势预测报告》中发现，报告内出现了「煤炭（Coal）出自《Minecraft》，是可再生资源，收获来自煤矿石以及击杀凋灵骷髅获得1-3个」等与调查内容无关的文字，引起了网友热议。\n\n48:59 书籍：《九诗心》，作者：黄晓丹\n\n53:43  此处出自《圣经》和合本 以赛亚书，表达容耶稣在外貌上并无任何出色之处——\n\n“他在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容；我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。”\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🥂 200期特辑听友征集\n\n在诸位听友的支持下，知行小酒馆马上就要做到 200 期啦，我们准备制作一期特别节目，怀着轻松愉悦的心情，聊一聊和大家一起走过的这 200 期。\n\n关于小酒馆，你有什么好奇的问题？又或者，有些话想告诉我们很久了，但一直没机会说。趁着这个机会，都写下来吧！\n\n你的提问或分享，有可能会出现在我们的节目之中。欢迎你扫码参与问卷，或点击链接，共创属于我们的纪念时刻！干杯！\n\n\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 王汉洋｜主持 雨白｜后期  剪王｜制作 星星 雨烨｜单集封面  嘉宾供图\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "url": "http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/06/weekly-issue-352.html",
    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n6月6日凌晨，太原基地发射的长征六号火箭，飞过西安城墙。（via）\nBug 追踪系统的正确样子\n上周的话题是 GitHub Issues，把它当作笔记工具，很强悍。\n但是，有些话来不及说。它的本职工作----Bug 追踪系统----并不好用。\n\n你用它来管理 Bug，就会发现有设计缺陷，用起来不顺手。\n\n现在还活着的、历史最悠久的 Bug 追踪系统是 Bugzilla。\n它的一个早期工程师，前不久写了一篇文章，介绍 Bugzilla 的四条设计原则。\n他说，只有满足这四点，才是一个好的 Bug 追踪系统（bug tracking system），我感到很有启发。\n（1）所有任务都要列入 Bug 追踪。不仅包括代码 Bug，还包括待开发的新功能、缺失的文档、令人困惑的用户体验、糟糕的性能等等。\n换言之，Bug 追踪系统本质是任务管理，应该当作项目管理系统来用。\n（2）Bug 的状态有多种，不只\"打开\"和\"关闭\"两种。\n大公司的 Bug 处理流程，可能很复杂，下面是一张从 Bugzilla 文档拷贝的流程图。\n\nBug 追踪系统应该足够灵活，可以自定义优先级、严重程度、是否已分配、是否有依赖等等，以便适配各种流程。\n（3）每个 Bug 只能由一人负责。 \n这样才能明确责任，方便查看每个人正在做什么、接下来要做什么、以及最近做了什么。这也有利于培养开发者的归属感和成就感。\n（4）支持自定义视图。\n由于 Bug 有多种状态，追踪系统必须支持自定义视图查看，拥有强大的查询功能。\n系统的默认视图：按照优先级，列出当前版本的所有没有关闭的 Bug。\n开发者的个人视图：列出分配给他们的所有 Bug，同样按优先级排序。另外，用户可以保存自己的自定义视图。\n以上四条，就是好的 Bug 追踪系统的标准。问题是 GitHub Issues 一条都没做到。\n项目管理功能太弱。\n状态只能靠标签。\n任务可以分配给多个人。\n视图默认按创建时间排序，且只能切换成标签视图。\n在这方面，GitHub 甚至不如 Gitea。\n举例来说，GitHub 没有办法让最重要的 Bug（P0 级别），自动出现在第一位（下图），除非手动置顶。\n\n相比之下，Gitea（包括分叉的 Forgejo）提供了\"标签集\"（label set），允许一个标签有多个值，并可以按同一个标签的值排序。\n\n上图中，标签\"Priority\"（优先级）有多个值，然后系统允许按照 Priority 的值排序。\n[本周软件] 开源知识库 PandaWiki\n小团队和个人，如何管理大量文档，搭建自己的知识库？\n今天，介绍一个刚刚开源的知识库管理系统 PandaWiki。\n\n它采用维基形式，可以随意编排文档，既能搭建传统的文档站，也能做成 FAQ 和博客。\n它原生支持 AI 创作、AI 问答、AI 搜索等能力。你可以用自然语言跟知识库对话，也能使用嵌入模型，找出相关文档。\n大家可以去 Demo 体验一下，详细了解看官方文档。\n\n它的后端使用 Go 语言编写，速度非常快。安装使用 Docker，一行命令就能跑起来。\n代码库放在 GitHub，可以从那里上手，目前已经有600多颗星星。\n任正非专访\n本周，《人民日报》头版刊登任正非专访。\n下面是一些摘录。\n（1）芯片问题其实没必要担心。我们单芯片还是落后美国一代，我们用数学补物理、非摩尔补摩尔，用群计算补单芯片，在结果上也能达到实用状况。\n（2）软件是卡不住脖子的，那是数学的图形符号、代码，一些尖端的算子、算法垒起来的，没有阻拦索。困难在我们的教育培养、人才梯队的建设。\n（3）当我国拥有一定经济实力的时候，要重视理论特别是基础理论的研究。如果不搞基础研究，就没根。即使叶茂，欣欣向荣，风一吹就会倒的。\n（4）我们要理解支持搞理论工作的。理论科学家是孤独的，我们要有战略耐心，要理解他们。他们头脑中的符号、公式、思维，世界上能与他们沟通的只有几个人。对理论科学家要尊重，因为我们不懂他的文化，社会要宽容，国家要支持。\n（5）买国外的产品很贵，因为价格里面就包含他们在基础研究上的投入。中国搞不搞基础研究，也要付钱的，能不能付给自己搞基础研究的人。\n（6）华为一年1800亿投入研发，大概有600亿是做基础理论研究，不考核。1200亿左右投入产品研发，投入是要考核的。没有理论就没有突破，我们就赶不上美国。\n（7）人工智能也许是人类社会最后一次技术革命，当然可能还有能源的核聚变。发展人工智能要有电力保障，中国的发电、电网传输都是非常好的，通信网络是世界最发达的，东数西算的理想是可能实现的。\n（8）赞声与骂声，都不要在意，而要在乎自己能不能做好。把自己做好，就没有问题。\n科技动态\n（1）中国科大提出\"火星电池\"的方案。\n\n这种电池可以在火星上，储存太阳能的发电，在夜间释放出来。\n它的原理是，电解火星大气的二氧化碳，将其转为氧气和甲烷等燃料气体，在夜间再点燃发电。\n（2）华为旗下的深圳引望公司，申请了一个\"可收纳方向盘\"专利。\n\n根据描述，这个专利可以将方向盘折叠起来，放入操作台里面。\n\n（3）瑞士建造了世界最高的 3D 打印建筑：一个高达30米的观光塔，外形酷似当地的一种著名糖果。\n\n为了增加承重能力，施工方采用了特制的混凝土材料。并且，增加了第二台机器，每打印20厘米，就往建筑物里面加入钢筋。\n\n（4）苹果公司本周发布的新版 macOS，出现了一个细小的调整。\n\n文件管理器 Finder 的图标左右反转了，上图左是原来的图标，右是新版图标。目前不知道，为什么要这样反转。\n文章\n1、过去半年的大模型回顾（英文）\n\nSimon Willison 点评过去半年的大模型，可以当成大事记来读。\nAI 的进展实在太快，去年底的模型已经是上一代了。\n2、我使用 Claude Code Max 的感受（英文）\n\n作者购买了 Claude Code 的 Max 会员，一个月要200美元，使用后认为完全物有所值。\n3、速率限制交互式指南（英文）\n\n如何限制访问速率？本文介绍了四种常用算法：令牌桶、漏水桶、固定窗口、滑动窗口。\n4、Amazon VPC 图解（英文）\n\n本文用插图解释，云服务器的虚拟私有网络（VPC，Virtual Private Cloud 的缩写）是什么。\n5、五个自搭建的书签服务（英文）\n\n本文介绍五个开源软件，可以自己架设网址书签的收藏服务。\n6、我的香港露营实验（英文）\n\n2016年，一个老外在香港留学，他的奖学金很少，就想在海边搭帐篷居住，省下房租。本文是他对这段生活的总结，挺有意思的。\n工具\n1、Cap.js\n\n一个网页上的机器人识别工具，用作 CAPTCHA 方案，采用 SHA-256 工作量证明算法。\n2、Quartz\n\nMarkdown 文档的静态站点发布器，适合用作收费服务 Obsidian Publish 的替代品。\n3、somo\n\n在 Linux 终端查看端口占用情况的工具。\n4、OOMOL Studio\n\n一款创新的桌面 IDE，把自己编写的函数设成节点，然后通过图形界面，把节点编排成工作流。（@BlackHole1 投稿）\n5、极测\n\n免费的通信调试助手，模拟 UDP、TCP、串口、WebSocket、ZeroMQ 等常见协议，进行通信测试。（@seasonlaw 投稿）\n6、container\n苹果官方发布的 Mac 电脑运行 Linux 容器的工具。也就是说，Mac 电脑可以不装 Docker，就运行 Docker 容器。\n7、DarkFlare\n一个命令行工具，在 CDN 上，将 TCP 流量伪装成 HTTPS 流量传输。\n8、JDownloader\n\n开源的全平台下载工具，参考这篇教程，用树莓派搭建下载服务器。\n9、Pydoll\n一个操作浏览器的 Python 库，通过 Chrome DevTools Protocol，实现脚本操作本机的 Chrome 浏览器。\n10、Chili3D\n\n基于浏览器的 3D CAD 软件，代码开源。\nAI 相关\n1、Page Magic\n\n一个 Chrome 的 AI 插件，输入你对当前网页的修改描述，它自动将改好的网页呈现在浏览器里，需要 Anthropic API。\n2、壁响（WallEcho）\n\n根据输入的文本，免费生成手机或电脑桌布。（@twjiem 投稿）\n3、AI 洞察日报\n\n通过 Cloudflare Workers 抓取指定数据源，生成每日精选的 AI 日报，效果预览。（@justlovemaki 投稿）\n4、zenfeed\n\n智能信息助手，对于关注的新闻或话题，使用 AI 自动收集、筛选出要看的文章，并总结内容。（@glidea 投稿）\n5、文颜 MCP Server\nAI 模型接入这个 MCP，就可以将排版好的内容，自动发布到微信公众号，参见介绍文章。（@caol64 投稿）\n资源\n1、高等院校三千所\n\n这个网站收录中国大学网址全集。（@DiamonWoo 投稿）\n2、Mullvad Leta\n\nMullvad 公司推出的一个搜索引擎。它从谷歌和 Brave 获取搜索结果，但是提供隐私保护，防止搜索引擎识别用户。\n我试用感觉不错，速度很快，没有广告。\n3、DNS4EU\n\n欧盟推出的公共 DNS，自带过滤广告功能。\n图片\n1、居里夫人故居的门把手\n著名物理学家居里夫人，由于长期接触放射性元素，手上总是沾有镭矿石的微粒。\n她在法国巴黎的故居，过了100年，至今仍能测出，门把手有微弱的放射性。\n\n1934年，居里夫人死于过量辐射导致的再生性贫血。\n\n2、洞穴停车场\n美国密苏里州早年有石灰矿，挖出了巨大的地下空洞。\n\n后来，矿产挖光以后，这些空洞就废弃了。\n上个世纪50年代，福特汽车公司看中了这个地方。因为这里的地下空间非常大，可以容纳5000人，没有风吹雨打，没有下雪结冰，干燥，终年恒温，很适合改造成停车场，存放新车。\n\n\n这个地下停车场直到今天还在运作，可能是史上最大的地下商业设施。\n\n文摘\n1、小模型\n在机器学习的早期，\"小模型\"指的是可以在家用电脑 CPU 运行的基本神经网络。\n到了2018年，如果你问别人什么是\"小模型\"，他们可能会说，就是那种在树莓派或手机上运行的、只有几百万个参数的模型。\n但是，后来出现了 Transformer 和大型语言模型（LLM）。这些模型越变越大，\"小模型\"的定义已经改变。\n今天，任何不需要 A100 显卡集群就能运行的模型，都可以看成小模型。\n我们把300亿个参数（30B）的模型也称为\"小模型\"，因为它们只需要一个 GPU 就能运行。\n今天的\"小模型\"，更多的是指模型的可部署性，而不仅仅是模型的规模。\n如果能在个人设备上部署某个模型，那么这个模型就是小模型。它可以分成下面两类。\n（1）可以在移动设备或边缘硬件上运行的模型，用例为语音助手、手机翻译、离线摘要、嵌入的聊天机器人。\n（2）只需一个 GPU 的模型，在这一类中，即使是 30B 或 70B 规模的模型也可以算作\"小型\"。\n现在，一张4090显卡就能运行 70B 的模型，并有不错的输出速度，这在几年前还只是科幻小说的情节。\n小模型固然比不上大模型的能力，但也有自己的优势：更适合小型的任务，在单一领域更准确，更适合微调和快速发布。\n而且，小模型的成本更低，更适合个人和创业公司部署，并可以在本地部署。\n这就是为什么小模型很有用，因为它让我们可以在家里运行自己的 AI 模型，得到的结果与 GPT-3.5 不相上下，从而可以用更少的资源完成更多的任务。\n言论\n1、\n很多人总是拖拖拉拉，抱怨自己没有做事的动力。但是，动力恰恰源自行动，只要你开始做一些事情，只要能朝着目标前进，你就会发现动力随之而来。\n所以，当我遇到一个很艰巨的任务时，我会把问题分解成若干更简单的部分，此时我的目标不是完成任务，而只是让自己能够行动起来，向前迈出一小步。\n-- 《摆脱拖延症》\n2、\n最安全的代码并非优美、巧妙或优雅的代码，而是枯燥乏味的代码。\nGo 语言就奉行这种理念，故意去除了那些富有表现力或优雅的写法，只保留简洁和可读的写法。这使得代码易于审查、难于滥用，不容易发生安全漏洞。\n-- 《无聊胜过美丽》\n3、\n人们总是喜欢新东西，读书喜欢读新出版的书，听歌喜欢听新歌。\n据统计，美国2024年流媒体音乐一共播放了1.4万亿次，其中近50%是2020年至2024年期间发行的歌曲，近80%是2010年或之后发行的歌曲。歌越老，听的人越少。\n-- 美联社\n4、\n新 API 的采用速度将会大大减缓。因为大模型的学习内容仅限于已有的内容，新的 API 出现时，可供学习的内容必然很少。\n另外，那些依赖大模型的人也会犹豫是否采用新 API，因为大模型使用旧 API 可以更快地完成相同的工作。\n-- Hacker News 读者\n往年回顾\n随机数，这是一个问题（#305）\n对待 AI 的正确态度（#255）\n互联网风口过去了吗？（#205）\n数字货币是打破美元霸权的武器吗？（#155）\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2025年6月13日",

    "description": "「你只活一辈子，要活得不一样。」\n\n今天的嘉宾是刚刚进入新阶段的影石 Insta360 创始人，刘靖康。\n\n\n\n本周三，6 月 11 日，影石成功登陆 A 股科创板，开盘即大涨 285%，市值一度突破 700 亿元人民币。\n影石现在把全景相机做到了世界第一，在运动相机的市场份额，也已接近目前排名第一的老牌玩家 GoPro，且有反超的趋势。\n\n\n图注：搭载卫星倍长征二号火箭发射升空后，Insta360 ONE X 系列全景相机拍到的地球与银河的同框。\n\n两年前的夏天，我们就访谈过刘靖康，文章在这里：《影石 Insta360 刘靖康：当机会稀缺，年轻的后来者如何做到第一？》\n\n现在再与刘靖康聊，他对怎么做产品，怎么运营一个更复杂的组织，都有了更深的实践和思考。他更清晰地描述了自己的长期目标——一个是做世界级的产品，一个是做一个新形态的学习型商业组织。\n\n他也分享了仍需修炼的能力，和仍然存在的困惑。\n\n刘靖康说，他做很多事的动力之一是 YOLO，You only live once，你只活一次。那么，该怎么对待只有一次的人生？创业、做产品和做公司，都是他的答案之一。\n\n本期嘉宾：刘靖康（JK），影石 Insta360 创始人\n\n时间线跳转：\n\n-从“猎人策略”到“包围式差异化”进攻\n01:32 这有点儿像，你 4 年前就领了证，今天才办婚礼\n04:14 两年三变化\n07:37 “猎人策略”进化，新的 3 种 level\n13:00 AcePro 为何跳入与 DJI Action、GoPro 的更直接竞争？\n18:57 包围式差异化式进攻\n22:25 影像是「开放世界的市场」，就像游戏，产品之间难以等效替代\n25:28 不要忽视任何环节做好带来的增益，和没做好带来的损失\n\n-防比攻更难，但能力提升也更快\n27:48 大疆也要发布全景相机了，如何应对？\n31:06 Ace 系列有挫折，但此刻是好结果\n34:00 两种产品思路：需求导向 vs 竞争导向的平衡\n37:18 员工学滑雪、潜水，费用都报销，鼓励他们成为目标客户\n41:29 全焦段、全场景，愿景是“帮助人们更好记录和分享生活”，而不只是运动\n43:56 防比攻更难，但也更能带来能力提升\n\n-开放世界竞争，有门槛、难有壁垒\n49:00 大多数消费电子品类，有门槛、难有壁垒\n54:18 无人机市场的门看似焊死了，其实也能推开\n55:11如果我账上的钱只够活三个月，傻子才会跟他竞争\n56:57 抓住大机会的公司都不是“白纸”，是机会到来时能力积累最 ready 的组织\n59:16 试，这不是最经济的方式\n01:03:03 say no 的方向：为何不做车载？电影机曾经的失利\n01:09:24 何时谋定而后动，何时跳下水迭代\n\n-控制住，别直接给答案\n01:18:15 AcePro 2 街拍套装都要上市了，我才知道\n01:22:00 提高决策能力的唯一方法是，决策、行动，然后获得反馈\n01:27:03 最难的是，克制住直接给方案的冲动，这反人性\n01:29:42 表扬要公开，批评要单独；给负反馈时，不要高高举起、轻轻放下\n01:31:55 试图打造员工发展第一，客户第二，股东第三的组织\n01:36:39 这家公司赚的是“开发新知识”的钱\n01:40:35 面对员工吐槽：识别目标员工，解决共性问题\n01:42:27 定期识别隐性职责和跨部门职责\n01:50:00 矩阵式组织的关键是，上下左右对齐目标\n01:54:49 组织上什么最难？激发人心\n\n你的底层不是一场战争，是 YOLO\n01:58:40 组织复杂性将持续，但会迭代优化\n02:01:26 眼镜也许是大机会，但非 Insta360 的大机会\n02:07:50 迄今为止，最勇敢的选择\n02:12:07 害怕失去，所以 YOLO，所以勇敢\n02:14:39 你的底层，不是一场战争\n02:17:50 有了孩子后，发现家庭记录场景的更高上线\n02:19:18 4 个太多 & 4 个不够\n02:21:09 被采访是提炼想法、明文表达的时机\n02:22:00 我们就是公司里的极限运动玩家，不求安逸，All in or nothing\n\n相关链接：\n《影石 Insta360 刘靖康：当机会稀缺，年轻的后来者如何做到第一？》\n晚点聊 118：天生卷王郭人杰：从 97 年的扫地机总裁到创业做家庭通用机器人\n\n剪辑制作：Nick\n\n本期主播：小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "这一期对谈，从生娃前约到了娃快一岁，真是拖了好久好久。\n\n邀请来的嘉宾，是暂停实验室的创始人郭婷婷。\n\n知道暂停实验室，是因为不少 flomo 用户推荐。\n\n后来也才知道，在暂停实验室，书写也是重要的工具之一，创始人郭婷婷，也是「爱写字的人」。\n\n后来聊了许多，才发现两个人性格迥异，但最终却又殊途同归。\n\n因为书写，能帮助自己优化思维方式，减少情绪困扰，靠近自己想要的生活目标。\n\n所以在这期播客中，我们主要聊了聊书写的价值是什么，为何现在的人越来越不爱书写，以及为什么书写恰恰是这个时代的人们非常需要和不可替代的。\n\n当然，中间还有作为一个产品经理的好奇心：如何对这种线上服务进行量化，确保服务质量呢？\n\n本期主播&嘉宾：\n\n  \n郭婷婷：暂停实验室创始人，21 年心理学和脑科学研究 & 从业经验，临床和心理咨询硕士\n  \n少楠：flomo 联合创始人\n\n\nTimeline：\n\n  \n00:17 没想到我们的用户重合这么多！老被互相 cue 的我们，终于一起聊天啦！\n  \n02:11：一个几乎不用笔记工具的人 VS 一个笔记工具爱好者\n  \n04:23 我们分别会记录些什么？\n  \n09:19 为什么记录情绪很难？\n  \n19:07 书写是一种思维训练\n  \n26:31 少楠：绕了很大圈子才找到的心理学书写方法\n  \n27:38 来自产品人的好奇：暂停实验室怎么衡量产品是否有效呢\n  \n41:30 婷婷：书写可以帮你做成想做的事，改掉想改的习惯，真正成为自己的主人\n  \n48:52 少楠：我把跨越时间周期的好几年的笔记导入 AI ，发现了令人兴奋的洞察\n  \n58:12 福利时间！\n\n\n🎁 婷婷带给《奇想驿》的听友福利：\n\n给 flomo 付费用户（同时也是暂停老用户）：\n\n  \n如何参与？活动时间内（自播客发布日起，至 2025 年 6 月 30 日），在本期播客评论区，聊聊你在暂停实验室的练习体验和改变、使用 flomo 的感受。👉 送暂停福利豆 100（可用于复训及购买新的练习计划）\n  \n如何兑奖？微信找你的暂停实验室「各色小助手」，发送：1.你的走心评论截图 + 2.小宇宙个人主页截图 + 3.flomo 付费会员绑定账号截图（flomo 左上角 - 设置 -账号与密码 页面），即可领取【暂停福利豆 100】（可用于复训及购买新的练习计划）\n  \n给其他听到这期播客的 flomo 老用户（暂不是暂停用户的朋友）：如果听完已经种草想来暂停实验室试试，那也送个优惠！搜索关注微信服务号「暂停实验室」，回复暗号「少楠」就可以领优惠报名，长期有效！\n\n\n音乐\n\n  \n片头：Glimpse by Vraell\n  \n片尾：Sæglópur  by Sigur Rós\n\n\n感谢暂停实验室制作团队对音频进行录制、剪辑。\n\n*老用户定义：暂停实验室老用户，指：在暂停参与过至少一期训练营的朋友；flomo 老用户，指：flomo 付费用户（不限制年费会员期限）",

Digital receipts are gaining traction, with Realtimes UK reporting that a quarter of UK retailers now offer them exclusively.\nIn physical stores, traditional paper receipts represent missed opportunities: static, one-time records that serve little purpose beyond proof of purchase. In contrast, digital receipts unlock a dynamic stream of customer insights, which are a gateway to AI-powered personalization, enabling retailers to transform sales data into timely, relevant recommendations.\nRetailers are also seeing greater adoption of their customer loyalty apps by embedding features like digital receipts and personalized offers, giving shoppers more reasons to engage after leaving the store.\nRetailers are increasingly investing in digital receipts, and MongoDB enables them to digitize in-store transactions, understand shopper behavior, and deliver personalized product suggestions immediately after checkout. With MongoDB’s flexible document model , retailers can efficiently store and analyze rich transactional data, powering real-time personalization and adaptive customer experiences. It’s a smarter, data-driven approach to customer engagement, built for the physical retail world.\nThe challenge in capturing the in-store customer journey\nPersonalized shopping experiences are a proven driver of customer loyalty and revenue, but to deliver them effectively, retailers need a complete view of each customer’s journey. For retailers who have a brick-and-mortar presence, that’s where the gap lies.\nToday, many retailers are making personalization decisions based on incomplete data. While loyalty programs and customer profiles may capture some purchase history, in-store transactions often go unrecorded or take too long to turn into actionable insights. Paper receipts dominate the checkout process, and without a digital trail, these interactions are lost to the retailer’s systems. This means that even a highly engaged, in-store shopper may appear invisible when it comes to targeting and recommendations.\nThe impact of this is twofold. First, it limits the retailer’s ability to offer relevant product suggestions, personalized promotions, or timely follow-ups, missing key opportunities to increase basket size and repeat visits. Second, it affects the customer experience, particularly in the retailer’s mobile app. Shoppers who frequent physical stores often find that their app doesn’t reflect their recent purchases or preferences, making it feel disconnected and less useful.\nBy digitizing receipts, retailers can close this gap. Every in-store purchase becomes a rich source of insight, directly tied to the customer profile. This enables more accurate, real-time personalization, both right after checkout and in future interactions. It also adds meaningful value to the retailer’s mobile app: customers see their full purchase history, receive smarter recommendations, and access personalized offers that feel relevant. The business impact is significant: better personalization drives more revenue, while a more engaging app experience leads to higher adoption, increased usage, and stronger loyalty.\nGetting the most out of day-to-day data: Building a digital receipt solution\nRetailers aiming to enhance personalization must first digitize in-store transactional data, particularly the information generated at checkout from point-of-sale (POS) systems. However, the majority of existing POS systems have fixed, non-changeable data formats, designed primarily for payment processing. These systems often vary across store locations, lack integration with customer profiles, and don't support rapid data access.\nTo address these challenges, retailers should centralize transaction data from all stores into a consistent and accessible format. Ensuring each purchase is reliably linked to a customer identity, through loyalty sign-ins or digital prompts, and storing that information in a manner that supports immediate, personalized engagement is crucial.\nIntegration with POS systems is essential, allowing retailers to capture transaction data instantly and store it.\nA flexible document model (like MongoDB’s) stores structured, unstructured, and AI-ready data in one format, making it ideal for managing complex customer profiles and purchase histories. It captures detailed transaction data, including items, prices, context, and nested info like product attributes, preferences, and loyalty activity, all within a single document.\nFigure 1. MongoDB’s document model contains the data used to render the digital receipts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis image shows how MongoDB's document model supports digital receipts by instantly ingesting all receipt details. It features a MongoDB document (left) containing both purchased product information and personalized recommendations, and the digital receipt on PDF (right).\nIt also makes the data instantly usable for personalization engines and AI models, without the need for heavy transformation or complex joins across multiple systems. Should the retailer have several different brands or types of PoS systems which data in different formats, the flexible document model allows them to be combined more easily, including fast onboarding if new types are introduced.\nSeamless integration allows connectivity with existing POS systems and third-party analytics tools, reducing friction in adoption. MongoDB enables this through features like real-time data ingestion with change streams, flexible data connectors for systems like Kafka, and an API-driven approach that supports REST. Combined with MongoDB Atlas’s multi-cloud deployment support, retailers can connect and scale across diverse infrastructures without needing to re-architect their existing systems.\nRetailers can surface digital receipts directly in the customer-facing app, enhancing the post-purchase experience. Shoppers gain instant access to their full purchase history, enabling features like receipt lookups, easy reorders, warranty tracking, and personalized product suggestions. This drives more app adoption and keeps customers engaged beyond the store visit.\nTo support this experience at scale, retailers need an architecture that can handle high volumes of receipt data from numerous store locations. MongoDB Atlas supports this through horizontal scalability and workload isolation, ensuring operational workloads like customer app interactions remain fast and reliable as data grows. Some retailers optimize storage by keeping receipt metadata in MongoDB while storing the full receipt in an object store like Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage, enabling a cost-effective approach.\nFigure 2. Architecture diagram showing the Digital Receipts components.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMongoDB’s ability to serve real-time queries with low latency ensures that every tap or search in the app feels instant, helping reinforce customer trust and satisfaction. This makes the app not just a digital companion but a key driver of loyalty and repeat visits.\nBy making digital receipts easily accessible in the app, alongside personalized recommendations and seamless post-purchase interactions, retailers create a more engaging and convenient experience that keeps customers coming back. Increased app adoption leads to more touchpoints, better data collection, and more opportunities to upsell or cross-sell, ultimately boosting revenue and retention.\nA notable example of a retailer leveraging MongoDB for digital receipts is Albert Heijn, the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands. By utilizing MongoDB Atlas, Albert Heijn developed a digital receipts feature within their customer-facing app, providing shoppers with real-time and historical insights into their in-store purchases. This adoption of MongoDB Atlas led to annual savings of 25%, improved developer productivity, and a more efficient customer experience.\nRetailers use digital receipt data to improve personalized recommendations by combining purchase history, preferences, and behavior. Digitized receipts enable tracking of items, frequency, and context, allowing real-time linking of in-store purchases to customer profiles for more accurate, timely offers.\nFigure 3. Diagram showing the Digital Receipts process flow.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe image illustrates the digital receipts process: 1. A customer makes a purchase in-store, 2. receives a digital receipt via email or SMS, 3. verifies it through an app, 4. accesses purchase history and personalized recommendations, and 5. can repurchase items through the app.\nUsing MongoDB’s aggregation pipelines and change streams, retailers can process data efficiently and enable AI-driven personalization immediately after checkout. This streamlined handling of structured and unstructured receipt data supports rapid analysis of customer preferences and purchasing patterns. MongoDB's workload isolation ensures that analytical processes do not impact the performance of customer-facing applications, maintaining a seamless user experience.\nRetailers can enhance customer engagement by leveraging this data to offer personalized promotions, loyalty rewards, and cross-selling opportunities.\nReady to embrace digital receipts?\nDigital receipts are reshaping how brick-and-mortar retailers unlock customer insights and deliver AI-driven personalization. With MongoDB Atlas, retailers can instantly analyze transactional data, customer preferences, and purchase history within a flexible document model, powering real-time, tailored recommendations that increase basket size, drive repeat purchases, and boost conversions. Beyond personalization, digital receipts reduce printing costs and support sustainability by eliminating paper waste, while offering customers a convenient, app-based way to access and search past purchases.\nThe real value lies in the data: by capturing rich, real-time insights from every in-store transaction, retailers can unify physical and digital touchpoints, improving customer engagement and business agility. MongoDB’s scalable architecture and real-time processing empower retailers to adapt quickly to changing behavior and deliver seamless, data-driven experiences.\nNow is the time to modernize your customer engagement strategy. Digital receipts aren’t just a convenience; they’re a competitive advantage!\nDiscover how MongoDB Atlas can help you deliver seamless customer experiences across all channels through our solutions page.",

    "description": "👋 大家好 ，我是设计师竹子，我又来和大家分享有趣的AI设计了，这次继续分享的是最近大火的《藏海传》题材，上次做勋章，大家非常喜欢，问我怎么做到那么精致统一的，其实就是多刷图，需要耐心和审美结合。今天我做的是《藏海传》的手办盲盒。\n\n💡 这次关键词我只提供了藏海版本给大家参考，在帖子的末尾提供了公式，如果是粉丝剧迷，应该可以自行根据人物添加补充相应的关键词，做自己喜欢的手办，至于我使用的工具还是使用了即梦3.0工具制作。在做手办的过程中，我觉得有几个点需要注意的：\n\n1️⃣ 生僻用字的处理 我提供的关键词虽然可以直出所有的图片和文字，但还是有一些非常用字出的不太好，比如“蒯铎”这两个字，我的解决办法是看下字形笔画，把“蒯”写成“荆”然后再去做一个“朋”字替换一下“开”就可以做出“蒯”字了\n\n2️⃣ 人物形象的处理 就是我做的是Q版，不是写实，所以要像人物像，你得抓特征，比如高明有点微胖，庄芦隐也有点胖，但是高明是笑眯眯的，而庄芦隐是很严肃威严的，你需要抓好这些表情点\n\n3️⃣ 就是选择出图比例问题，小红书一般是3:4，但我有时候不会直接出3:4的图，而是选择1:1，因为不同的出图比例，出包装也不太一样。比如3:4容易出竖的包装，而1:1容易出横的包装。\n\n🎯 以上就是我一些心得，大家如果喜欢竹子的AI设计分享，记得给我小心心，接下来我将继续分享有趣的设计！❤️\n\n[爱心] 投稿作者：竹笋集\n\n📢 优设创作者招募中，快来优设分享你的作品吧！\n📢 添加微信：uisdc5687（备注：创作者入驻）\n\n👉🏻 更多 AIGC 实用干货，后台回复关键词 “AI工具”\n👉🏻 优设AI讲师招募中，如果你精通AI，这篇文章可能价值百万！",

    "description": "Grafana Tempo 2.8 is officially here, delivering new TraceQL features, performance improvements, and bug fixes, as well as some breaking changes. \nWatch the video below to learn more about the TraceQL features, or continue reading to get a quick overview of these and other updates. If you’re looking for something more in-depth for all of the changes that happened in this release, head over to the\nGrafana Tempo 2.8 release notes or the\nchangelog.\n\nTraceQL features\nNo Tempo release is complete without some new\nTraceQL features. Here are a few we’re excited to share from the 2.8 release. If you want to run the same queries you see in this post, you can go to our\nlocal Docker Compose example and follow the instructions there. Then, go to\nlocalhost:3000 and click on Explore, which should take you to Tempo.\nShow most recent results\nBy default, TraceQL searches are non-deterministic — they return the first matching results they find, not necessarily the most recent.\nA long-running community request has been to always return the most recent results. Now, in Tempo 2.8, we’ve added this feature\nas a query hint to modify the behavior of the query. If you specifically want the latest traces, use the TraceQL query hint with (most_recent=true). You can see a few more example queries in our\ndocs.\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{ resource.service.name=\"article-service\" } with (most_recent=true)\nUltimately we would like to make this the default TraceQL behavior, but due to regressions on certain queries, we decided to make it a query hint for now. We will re-evaluate as we continue to improve Tempo performance!\nSearch by parent span ID\nIf you have a parent span ID, you can now look up the associated children spans using the\nnew span:parentID intrinisic. \nFor example, let’s look at the span ID of a list-articles span:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample traces and spans\nWe can make our query as follows: \n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{ span:parentID = \"cb3557c2873e9e07\" }\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo children of span cb3557c2873e9e07\nAnd we can see that our parent, list-articles (cb3557c2873e9e07), has two children spans, which are fetch-articles (1420e572dec5a4d1) and authenticate (8c3c32d2f25bb86b).\nTo learn more about intrinsics, please visit our\ntechnical docs.\nMetrics: sum over time\nIn the\n2.7 release, we added three new\nTraceQL metrics functions: avg_over_time, min_over_time, and max_over_time. This time around\nwe’ve added sum_over_time, which lets you directly compute cumulative sums inside TraceQL, like total bytes transferred, total error counts, or resource consumption over time.\nHere’s an example:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{ span:name = \"foo\" } | sum_over_time(span:duration)\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_over_time on span duration\nMetrics: topk and bottomk\nWe’ve also\nadded support for topk and bottomk functions to provide you with more control over cardinality. These behave like the functions with the same names\nin Prometheus, allowing you to immediately narrow your focus to the top‑ or bottom‑ranked spans in a single, efficient query.  \nImagine a query that returns far too many series to be useful, for example:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{} | rate() by (span:name)\n\n\n\n\n\n{} | rate() by (span:name) over the last hour\nWe can use a function like topk(N) to better focus on the series that are interesting to us:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{} | rate() by (span:name) | topk(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n{} | rate() by (span:name) with narrowed focus using topk(2)\nSimilarly, you can focus on the lowest-valued series using bottomk(N):\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n{} | rate() by (span:name) | bottomk(10)\nTo see these functions in action, check out the video below, as well as the full\nTempo 2.8 release video.\n {\nresponded = true;\nresponse && response.status === 200 ? vimeo_is_up = true : vimeo_is_up = false;\n})\n.catch(error => {\nresponded = true;\n})\"\nx-cloak>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s supposed to be a video here, but for some reason there isn’t. Either we entered the id wrong (oops!), or Vimeo is down. If it’s the latter, we’d expect they’ll be back up and running soon. In the meantime,\ncheck out our blog!\nIf you want to learn more about TraceQL metrics queries, please check out our\ntechnical docs.\nAnd to learn more about the new TraceQL features covered in this section, take a look at our\nWhat’s new post.\nPerformance enhancements: compactor memory usage\nOne of the performance enhancements we’re most excited about with the Tempo 2.8 release relates to compactor pooling. \nWe noticed a spike in\ncompactor memory usage and an increase in the frequency of Out of Memory (OOM) errors over time. If we take a look at the following\nGrafana Pyrosocope flame graph for the compactor prior to an OOM, we can see that the vParquet4 row pool was holding 85% of in-use memory. This was due to overly aggressive pooling in the compactors, and was exposed by changes in traffic patterns that caused larger and larger traces to be stored and combined. \n\n\n\n\n\nA flame graph for compactor prior to an OOM.\nIn the 2.8 release, we are pooling less aggressively in the compactor and relying on the garbage collector to clean up traces.\nThis change has shown to have a huge improvement in memory, cutting memory high-water marks to less than half in a high traffic/tenant install.\nThat said, if we continue to see issues with compactor memory, we may continue to adjust this pooling value moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn improvement in compactor memory usage\nTo explore other performance improvements in the 2.8 release, please reference the\nrelease notes.\nBreaking changes\nWe’ve made a few breaking changes in the Tempo 2.8 release. Here, we’ll dig into some of these changes, but you can find the complete list in the\nrelease notes and\nupgrade guide.\nRemove Tempo serverless features\nIn Tempo 2.7, we\ndeprecated serverless features. In the 2.8 release, we\nfully removed them.\nAs a result, the following config options under querier.search are no longer valid. Please remove these if you are using them in your Tempo config:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nquerier:\nsearch:\nprefer_self: <int>\nexternal_hedge_requests_at: <duration>\nexternal_hedge_requests_up_to: <duration>\nexternal_backend: <string>\ngoogle_cloud_run: <string>\nexternal_endpoints: <array>\nAdditionally, the following serverless-related metrics have been removed:\ntempo_querier_external_endpoint_duration_seconds\ntempo_querier_external_endpoint_hedged_roundtrips_total\ntempo_feature_enabled\nYou can read more about this change\non GitHub.\nChange default http-listen-port from 80 to 3200\nIt was\nbrought up by users that port 80 is generally considered a privileged port, and most of the Tempo configuration (such as\nhere in our docker-compose examples) and packages use port 3200. As a result,\nwe’ve changed the default http-list-port to 3200 in the code, as well.\nMax attribute bytes\nIn the Tempo configuration, you could use max_span_attr_byte to set the max attribute size (bytes) for spans to avoid out-of-memory crashes. This configuration parameter is now renamed to max_attribute_bytes.\nPreviously, you could only use this parameter to only enforce max attribute size for spans and resources, but now\nit is also used for events, links, and instrumentation.\nWhat’s next in Grafana Tempo?\nLooking ahead, we’re now rolling out the new\nRF1 rearchitecture into production! As we start understanding our TCO savings, we will start sharing them. \nWe’re also adding a\nTempo MCP server to the query frontend so that LLM agents can leverage Tempo directly and do cool things like correcting syntax errors in queries. Stay tuned for more! \nIf you are interested in hearing more about Grafana Tempo news or search progress, please join us on the\nGrafana Labs Community Slack channel #tempo, post a question in\n our community forums, reach out on\nX (formerly Twitter), or join our\nmonthly Tempo community call.

    "description": "2023年4月3号，那一天，国内技术圈内讨论着一则八卦，在阿里效力15年的技术高管、语雀创始人玉伯，离职了。\n\n之后，玉伯短暂地在字节工作了一年，这段经历被他被形容为，「字节是他在阿里的第16年」。他觉得，「高管其实非常可怜……所有管理岗，最终你会上升到自己不胜任的位置。\n\n去年的5月，玉伯从字节离开，开始了围绕 AI 的独立创业——他所构建的Youmind 是一款服务创作者的AI 工具，用他的话来说，这次创业，是希望把当年服务开发者、帮助他人构建的那种快乐再次复现。\n\n我个人觉得，其实玉伯的创业故事，就是一个关于愿不愿、值不值的创业故事。\n\n在这两点前提下，能不能，只是一种过程。\n\n在全新创业者的身份下，玉伯经历了许多过去未曾预料过的挑战——比如融资遇阻、略显艰辛的产品定义等等。\n\n我在玉伯创业一周年之际，去杭州找他录制了这一期播客。就像他的个性签名「一个诚实的人」，在访谈中，他诚实地直面了很多关键问题。\n\n「如果是爬喜马拉雅山的话，我连一号营都没到。」\n\n「你已经创业一年了，但很多事情没想明白。你觉得这是完全合理的？」\n\n「这很合理。」\n\n如果说见到玉伯之前，我怀抱着一种对于天真派创业者的想象，可以说在见到他之后，这种想象被具象化了。但这种天真并非贬义，创业本就是选择一种生活方式。\n\n我特别喜欢玉伯所说的，他的创业就像种树、而他像一个园丁。\n\n「我小时候生活在农村，我非常知道一个果树施肥施早了，容易烧根。」\n\n「其实很多创业者都知道自己的西瓜还是青的，但就急着切。」\n\n老样子，这依旧是一期深度的、有趣的、彩蛋频出的创业者访谈。尽管玉伯登陆过许多播客，但在这期节目里，仍然有许多他首次讲述的内容。其中包含，一位大厂老兵选择创业的深层次动机，以及 AI 时代下，一类创业趋势的形成。\n\n希望这些坦诚的思考和分享。也能启发到你～\n\n本期嘉宾：玉伯（Youmind 创始人，语雀创始人）\n\n（Ps.这期节目发布的时间「6月12日」，是Youmind 成立一周年。应玉伯的要求，这期节目将在0点发布～祝贺 Youmind 生日快乐～❤️）\n\n\n\n本期Shownotes：\n\nPart 1. 关于玉伯的过去：缘何在技术圈有如此的影响力\n\n03:36 那些年，我在阿里内网当「嘴替」\n\n06:15 2023年4月3号，入职阿里15周年，我给自己发了一条钉钉消息，「赶快走！」🤣\n\n08:01 我常常有种恍惚看别人的故事感，一种他者视角\n\n10:05 凡是过往，皆是过往——我更关注未来和当下的自己\n\n12:00 玉伯的个性签名：一个诚实的人——为什么要诚实且表达？\n\n13:04 艾特瓦总：「最近一年我用即刻，发现挺有意思的」\n\nPart 2. 大厂那些年啊\n\n17:41 每个人都会寻找佐证自己经历的一些东西，这是要特别小心的\n\n18:27 做语雀之后，我发现很多事情其实没有对错\n\n20:42 在阿里期间，我给自己定下的「三个梦」：技术梦、产品梦、自由梦\n\n22:03 自由，就是能够掌控注意力的自由\n\n24:08 为了实现自由梦，必须离开大厂\n\n28:39 我曾想推动语雀和钉钉文档合并，现在回想那可能是一种虚荣心\n\n29:52 无招当时在文档上的认知比我深，「如果真这么做了也会死的很惨」\n\n36:21 在字节我学到很多，张一鸣渗透下的工具理性\n\n37:16 没有对错，但，「我真的不喜欢抖音」\n\n38:15 「有时候我觉得高管非常的可怜」\n\n39:38 有时候别人给我打上大厂高管的标签，我觉得挺无聊\n\n40:08 「你在字节有学到在阿里15年没学到过的东西吗？」「没有……」\n\n40:49 交朋友我肯定选马云，跟人合伙，我可能选张一鸣\n\n42:20 真的是字节一年，人间三年…\n\n49:21 去了字节我才发现阿里的好：曾经diss过的逍遥子班，我只看到了事情的一面…\n\nPart3. 谈 Youmind\n\n靠什么启动创业？\n\n53:10 创业前思考：愿不愿、能不能、值不值\n\n57:54 要用真实的饼画饼，不要用梦想画饼\n\n59:40 我猜有人（此处艾特@刘飞老师）可能觉得我太理想主义，不够务实\n\nYoumind 到底是什么？\n\n01:00:39 去年找融资，聊了八、九十家，快崩溃了\n\n01:02:30 我要做 AI 时代的纸和笔\n\n01:06:35 AI 能提供的三种陪伴：Youmind 会提供一起构建、创造的快乐（就像我当年做语雀那样）\n\n01:20:58 我到底能用 Youmind 做什么？\n\n01:23:25 骨子里的开源精神影响我的产品观：产品只是个胚胎，Youmind 需要干爹干妈\n\n01:28:02 用户都把功能玩出花了\n\nYoumind 的灵魂拷问：\n\n01:10:54 创作真的没有门槛吗？真的人人皆可创作吗？\n\n01:12:13字节「Inspire creativity，Enrich Life」真挺好的；可我用起来不是那么回事儿😂\n\n01:12:41 「大多数投资人想要确定性的答案，可我现在给不了」「我得小马过河啊！」\n\n01:13:57 我也可以「骗」投资人\n\n01:25:38 既然都是种子用户一起共创了，还收费，合理吗？\n\n01:31:20 人的核心优势是遗忘，Youmind 鼓励闪婚\n\n01:34:12 和陌生人聊天…最好的陪伴未必要最「懂」你\n\n01:37:18 用户20美金支付的是什么？——这种关系好美妙啊\n\n01:38:32 用 Youmind ，其实也是在和玉伯神交\n\n01:46:43 20美刀，目前能 cover 住成本吗？\n\n那些创业教会我的事：\n\n01:15:48 语雀给过我快乐的环境，我想再造这种环境\n\n01:17:08 我想清楚了，什么是自由\n\n01:17:54 儿时农村的夜晚给我会心的笑容，后来，这种环境消失了\n\n01:18:33 我构建的是小环境，它受大环境的影响\n\n01:19:45 再cue瓦总🤣：相信AGI 的人都在即刻，但新闻联播在播「AI 是什么」\n\n01:36:26「 很多问题我现在没想清楚」——「你觉得这合理吗？」「很合理啊」\n\n01:48:56 擅长的事情似乎没那么擅长，不擅长的事情也未必真不擅长\n\n01:53:23 有些投资人替我着急：你怎么才几百用户？——我才创业几个月，都有几百用户了！\n\n01:54:33 许多人明明知道自己的瓜还是青的，但就急着切\n\n01:56:25 等树开花，创业一年，我反而不焦虑\n\n01:59:58 公司 Wi-Fi 名字： the great company\n\n02:00:07 我不做大，难道让抖音做大吗？哈哈哈哈\n\n加听友群👇\n\n有关主理人：卫诗婕，独立商业作者，曾任《极客公园》执行总编，早年任职于《人物》、GQ报道、字节跳动。代表作：《ofo的终场战事》、《罗永浩：薛定谔的理想主义》、《朱一旦的枯燥生活》、《中东社交十年风云：金矿、折戟、浪潮再起》、《下一站，沙特》等。作品曾获虎嗅2024年度作者、金字节奖年度新锐作者、网易非虚构文学奖年度作者、全球真实故事奖中文报道十佳。\n\n有关「商业漫谈」：这是一档关注科技、商业、人文的深度访谈节目，致力于记录时代的商业史。聚焦商业趋势、伦理、竞争、价值。",

    "title": "PointHealth AI: Scaling Precision Medicine for Millions",
    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/innovation/pointhealthai-scaling-precision-medicine-for-millions",
    "description": "For years, the healthcare industry has grappled with a persistent, frustrating challenge: the absence of a unified, precise approach to patient treatment. Patients often endure \"trial-and-error prescribing,\" leading to delayed recovery and a system bogged down by inefficiency. The core problem lies in scaling precision medicine—making advanced, individualized care accessible to millions of people.\nThis was the big obstacle that Rachel Gollub, CTO and co-founder of the VC-backed startup PointHealth AI, set out to overcome. With a vision to integrate precision medicine into mainstream healthcare, Gollub and her team are transforming how care is delivered, a mission significantly bolstered by their pivotal partnership with MongoDB.\nUncovering the gaps in healthcare treatment decisions\nOver a decade working within the insurance industry, Gollub and her co-founder, Joe Waggoner, observed a frustrating reality: persistent gaps in how treatment decisions were made. This wasn't just about inefficiency; it directly impacted patients, who often experienced \"trial-and-error prescribing\" that delayed their recovery. As Gollub states, they witnessed \"the frustrating gaps in treatment decision-making.\" It motivated them to seek a better solution.\nThe fundamental challenge they faced was scaling precision medicine. How could something so powerful be made accessible to millions rather than just a select few hundred? The biggest obstacle wasn't solely about the technology itself; it was about seamlessly integrating that technology into existing healthcare workflows.\nHow PointHealth AI eliminates treatment guesswork\nPointHealth AI's approach involves a proprietary AI reinforcement learning model. This system analyzes a range of data, including similar patient cases, detailed medical histories, drug interactions, and pharmacogenomic insights.\nWhen a physician enters a diagnosis into their health record system, PointHealth AI generates a comprehensive patient report. This report offers tailored treatments, actionable insights, and clinical considerations, all designed to guide decision-making. Gollub explains the company’s mission: \"to integrate precision medicine into mainstream healthcare, ensuring every diagnosis leads to the right treatment from the start.\" Its focus is on \"eliminating guesswork and optimizing care from the very first prescription.\" The objective is \"to deliver personalized, data-driven treatment recommendations.\"\nIts strategy for implementation involves direct partnerships with insurance companies and employers. By embedding its technology directly into these healthcare workflows, PointHealth AI aims to ensure widespread accessibility across the entire system. It’s also collaborating with health systems, electronic health record (EHR) companies, and other insurers.\nThe natural choice: Why PointHealth AI chose MongoDB Atlas\nA significant enabler of this progress has been PointHealth AI's partnership with MongoDB. Gollub's prior experience with both self-hosted and managed MongoDB provided confidence in its performance and reliability. MongoDB Atlas was a \"natural choice\" when selecting a data platform for PointHealth AI. It offered the features the team was looking for, including vector search, text search, and managed scalability. The provision of Atlas credits also swayed the decision.\nPointHealth AI had specific requirements for its data platform. It needed \"high security, HIPAA compliance, auto-scaling, fast throughput, and powerful search capabilities.\" The fact that MongoDB Atlas provided these features within a single, managed solution was huge.\nMongoDB Atlas ensures seamless backups and uptime through its managed database infrastructure. Its vector and text search capabilities are critical for effectively training AI models. The scaling experience has been \"seamless,\" according to Gollub.\nThe MongoDB team has offered \"invaluable guidance in architecting a scalable system.\" This support has enabled PointHealth AI to optimize for performance while remaining on budget. Gollub emphasizes that \"HIPAA compliance, scalability, expert support, and advisory sessions have all played critical roles in shaping our infrastructure.\"\nThe MongoDB for Startups program has proven impactful. The \"free technical advisor sessions provided a clear roadmap for our database architecture.\" The Atlas credits offered flexibility, allowing the team to \"fine-tune our approach without financial strain.\" Furthermore, the \"invaluable expert recommendations and troubleshooting support from the MongoDB advisor team\" have been a vital resource. Gollub extends a \"huge thank you to the MongoDB Atlas team for their support in building and scaling our system, and handling such an unusual use case.\"\nFrom pilots to Series A: PointHealth AI's next steps\nLooking forward, PointHealth AI has an ambitious roadmap for the current year. Its focus includes launching pilot installations and expanding partnerships with insurance and EHR companies. It’s also dedicated to refining its AI model to support a wider range of health conditions beyond depression. The overarching goal is to bring \"precision-driven treatment recommendations to physicians and patients.\" The aim, Gollub said, is to \"launch successful pilots, acquire new customers, and complete our Series A round.\"\nAs Gollub states, \"Precision medicine isn’t the future—it’s now.\" The team possesses the technology to deliver targeted treatment options, aiming to ensure patients receive the correct care from the outset. Their vision is to shape a healthcare system where personalized treatments are the standard.\nVisit PointHealth AI to learn more about how this innovative startup is making advanced, individualized care accessible to millions.\nJoin the MongoDB for Startups program to start building faster and scaling further with MongoDB!",

    "description": "在地缘政治日益紧张的当下，全球军费支出创下新高。2024年，全球军费总额达到 2.7万亿美元，其中仅美国、中国和俄罗斯三国就占据了超过一半。\n\n基于斯德哥尔摩国际和平研究所（SIPRI）数据，硅谷科技评论（SVTR.AI）梳理了全球主要国家的军费支出结构与背后的战略考量，并结合最新战车数据和军工企业估值，勾勒出当今全球防务生态的全貌。\n\n1、美国仍然“一骑绝尘”\n\n美国依然是全球军费支出最多的国家，2024年花费高达 9970亿美元，占全球总额的 36.7%。这一预算不仅远超其他国家，也反映了其维持全球军事影响力的核心战略。美国的军费开支约为GDP的3.4%，庞大的防务预算覆盖全球部署的航母战斗群、F-35战斗机计划、网络战能力建设等。\n\n中国的军费开支自2015年以来增长了59%，2024年比去年上涨7%，持续增强的国防预算支持我国海空军现代化、网络防御能力以及太空战力的发展。\n\n俄罗斯则在俄乌战争背景下将军费猛增38%，达到近1500亿美元，国防开支的急剧上升反映了战争的资源消耗和战略押注。\n\n德国和印度分列第四、第五，德国受乌克兰冲突刺激而提升军费，印度则因与中国和巴基斯坦的边境紧张局势持续加码军事投入。\n\n2、中国已成全球最大“钢铁洪流”\n\n尽管无人机对坦克构成新威胁，但坦克依然是传统地面战的主力。\n\nGlobal Firepower 数据显示：自2023年起，中国已超过俄罗斯和美国，成为全球坦克保有量最多的国家。值得注意的是，俄罗斯在乌克兰战场损失了约3000辆坦克，显示出高强度冲突下重装部队的脆弱性。\n\n3、谁掌控全球防务产业链？\n\n军费的流向最终也塑造了全球军工巨头的市场格局。\n\n美企在市值前25中占据超过一半，总市值超过 7430亿美元，反映出美国不仅是最大军费支出国，也控制着全球最有价值的防务企业网络。\n\n由联合技术公司与雷神公司的航空航天业务合并而成的RTX，作为全球最大军工企业，主打导弹、防空系统与航空引擎。\n\nSafran则代表了欧洲军工力量的崛起，其于2025年在美国弗吉尼亚设立新总部，标志着欧洲企业对北美市场的深度渗透。\n\n4、写在最后\n\n2024年的全球军事格局，映射出一个多极、紧张且不确定的世界。而技术的发展，从无人机、AI 到高超音速武器正在重塑传统战争形态。未来战场的定义，或许将由这些军费背后的创新力量决定。",

    "url": "https://grafana.com/blog/2025/06/11/data-points-per-minute-in-grafana-cloud-what-you-need-to-know-about-dpm/",
    "description": "If you’re working with metrics in Grafana Cloud, chances are you’ve come across DPM (data points per minute). It shows up in usage dashboards, invoice breakdowns, and occasionally pops up in Slack when your ingestion numbers start looking suspicious.\nDPM can also be seen in the Grafana Cloud\nbilling and usage dashboard, which is available by default in every Grafana Cloud account. It helps you understand how much data you’re sending—and whether it’s more than you need.\nBut what is DPM really measuring? Why does it matter? And what should you do if it’s higher than you expected?\nThis post is your all-in-one guide to understanding DPM: how it works, why we care about it, how to spot issues, and how to keep things clean and efficient.\nWhat Is DPM? (And why does it exist?)\nDPM is a measure of how frequently each unique time series sends data to Grafana Cloud. If you’re scraping a metric every 60 seconds, that series has a DPM of 1. Scrape it every 10 seconds? Now you’re at 6 DPM.\nGrafana Cloud uses DPM as a core part of its billing and usage model—and not arbitrarily. It’s a proxy for ingestion volume and system load. More DPM means more compute, more storage, and more bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the baseline: 1 DPM per active time series is what’s included in Grafana Cloud plans. That’s not just a quota—it’s the expected norm. For most metrics, 1 DPM is the sweet spot. It gives you the granularity you need for dashboards and alerting, without wasting resources or overloading your pipeline.\nWhy high DPM usually isn’t worth it\nYou might assume that scraping more frequently equals more accuracy, which equals better monitoring. But in reality, it’s usually just…more.\nDashboards don’t benefit: Most panels aggregate to 1 data point per pixel.\nAlerts won’t fire faster: Most rules evaluate once per minute or longer.\nCosts go up: Anything over 1 DPM is considered overage.\nIf you’re sending the same data six times more often, but not actually using that resolution, you’re just adding noise (and possibly higher bills).\nWhen higher DPM does make sense\nThat said, there are cases where more frequent data is genuinely useful. For example:\nSLO burn rate alerts with short time windows (e.g., 1-minute error windows)\nReal-time incident debugging where second-by-second changes matter\nLow latency systems like trading engines, game servers, or high frequency telemetry\nIn those scenarios, higher DPM might be intentional and worthwhile. Just be sure it’s driven by actual need, not default scrape configs.\nHow to investigate and reduce high DPM\nIf your usage dashboards show DPM creeping up, or your bill looks higher than expected, here’s a checklist to get things under control.\n1. Scrape intervals\nLook at your Prometheus or\nGrafana Alloy config. Are you scraping everything every 15 seconds? Try bumping lower priority targets to 30 or 60 seconds.\n2. Identify DPM per series with Explore\nTo see DPM per series for a specific metric, try this PromQL query in Explore:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nsort_desc(count_over_time({__name__=\"your_metric_name\"}[1m]))\nThis shows how frequently each series is sending data. If you’re not sure where to start, begin with metrics that have high cardinality and work your way down.\n3. Check for discarded writes\nSamples that get discarded still count toward your total DPM, even though they don’t show up in your active series count. You can find these in the billing and usage dashboard, under the panel titled “Discarded Metric Samples.”\n4. Aggregation by label set\nIf multiple instances emit identical label sets—even if each producer sends reasonable data—Grafana will merge them. This can lead to a DPM spike.\nTo address this, either:\nAdd a per-producer label (like instance) to separate them\nOr aggregate earlier (e.g., in the agent or via recording rules)\n5. Check recording rule frequency\nSometimes high DPM isn’t coming from scraped metrics at all—it’s being generated by recording rules. To find out if that’s the case:\nIn Grafana Cloud, go to Alerting > Alert Rules, edit a rule group, and check its evaluation interval.\nYou may also have recording rules defined in any upstream Prometheus instances. Validate those by checking the interval setting within the rule_group configuration.\n6. Cardinality dashboard\nThe\ncardinality management dashboard helps you spot when a single metric expands into thousands of unique label combinations. While high cardinality and high DPM aren’t directly connected, they often correlate in practice. That makes this dashboard a useful place to look when you’re investigating unexpected DPM spikes.\n7. Adaptive Metrics\nGrafana Cloud’s\nAdaptive Metrics feature is typically used to automatically suggest aggregations or drop unused series based on real usage patterns. \nBut it can also be used manually, as you can define custom Adaptive Metrics rules to drop specific metrics. This is especially useful when the source of the high DPM isn’t easily traceable or when you want more control over what gets retained.\n8. OpenTelemetry Collector / Grafana Alloy interval processors\nIf you’re using an OpenTelemetry collector (contrib or Grafana Alloy), you can control DPM directly at the pipeline level using an interval processor.\nThis component reduces the frequency of metric emission by aggregating metrics and periodically forwarding the latest values to the next component in the pipeline:\nIn OpenTelemetry Collector, see the\nintervalprocessor\nIn Alloy, check out the\notelcol.processor.interval component\nAnalyze metrics with dpm-finder\nIf you want a more direct, data-driven look at what’s actually being ingested—especially across a large set of metrics—a CLI tool can make that a lot easier.\nThis is where\ndpm-finder, a lightweight Python tool, comes into play. It connects directly to the Prometheus HTTP API to check how often each metric is being scraped, so you can get a clear picture of DPM across your dataset.\nSetting it up is pretty simple: Add the right environment variables, run the script, and dpm-finder gives you a list of metrics with their calculated DPM.\nIf you’re using Grafana Cloud, you can find all the connection details you’ll need in your stack settings at\ngrafana.com. Go to your stack, click Details under Prometheus, and copy:\nThe Prometheus remote write URL\nYour tenant ID (used as the username)\nThen, generate an API key with read access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave them as the following environmental variables:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nexport PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT=\"https://prometheus-XXX.grafana.net/api/prom\"\nexport PROMETHEUS_USERNAME=\"1234567\"\nexport PROMETHEUS_API_KEY=\"glc_XXX==\"\nInstall the required Python packages:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\nOnce everything’s set, run the script to get DPM results per active-series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nDPM isn’t just a billing metric—it’s a lens into how your observability pipeline behaves.\nIf you’re seeing unexpectedly high usage, start with scrape intervals and instrumentation. Use the dashboards. Use the tooling. Know when high DPM is worth it, and when it’s not.\n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more.

    "description": "Key Takeaways\nVector quantization fundamentals: A technique that compresses high-dimensional embeddings from 32-bit floats to lower precision formats (scalar/int8 or binary/1-bit), enabling significant performance gains while maintaining semantic search capabilities\nPerformance vs. precision trade-offs: Binary quantization provides maximum speed (80% faster queries) with minimal resources; scalar quantization offers balanced performance and accuracy; float32 maintains highest fidelity at significant resource cost\nResource optimization: Vector quantization can reduce RAM usage by up to 24x (binary) or 3.75x (scalar); storage footprint decreases by 38% using BSON binary format\nScaling benefits: Performance advantages multiply at scale; most significant for vector databases exceeding 1M embeddings\nSemantic preservation: Quantization-aware models like Voyage AI's retain high representation capacity even after compression\nSearch quality control: Binary quantization may require rescoring for maximum accuracy; scalar quantization typically maintains 90%+ retention of float32 results\nImplementation ease: MongoDB's automatic quantization requires minimal code changes to leverage quantization techniques\nAs vector databases scale into the millions of embeddings, the computational and memory requirements of high-dimensional vector operations become critical bottlenecks in production AI systems. Without effective scaling strategies, organizations face:\nInfrastructure costs that grow exponentially with data volume\nUnacceptable query latency that degrades user experience and limits real-time applications\nLimited and restricted deployment options, particularly on edge devices or resource-constrained environments\nDiminished competitive advantage as AI capabilities become limited by technical constraints and bottlenecks rather than use case innovation\nThis technical guide demonstrates advanced techniques for optimizing vector search operations through precision-controlled quantization—transforming resource-intensive 32-bit float embeddings into performance-optimized representations while preserving semantic fidelity. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas Vector Search’s automatic quantization capabilities with Voyage AI's quantization-aware embedding models, we'll implement systematic optimization strategies that dramatically reduce both computational overhead and memory footprint.\nThis guide provides an empirical analysis of the critical performance metrics:\nRetrieval latency benchmarking: Quantitative comparison of search performance across binary, scalar, and float32 precision levels with controlled evaluation of HNSW(hierarchical navigable small world) graph exploration parameters and k-retrieval variations.\nRepresentational capacity retention: Precise measurement of semantic information preservation through direct comparison of quantized vector search results against full-fidelity retrieval, with particular attention to retention curves across varying retrieval depths.\nWe'll present implementation strategies and evaluation methodologies for vector quantization that simultaneously optimize for both computational efficiency and semantic fidelity—enabling you to make evidence-based architectural decisions for production-scale AI retrieval systems handling millions of embeddings. The techniques demonstrated here are directly applicable to enterprise-grade RAG architectures, recommendation engines, and semantic search applications where millisecond-level latency improvements and dramatic RAM reduction translate to significant infrastructure cost savings.\nThe full end to end implementation for automatic vector quantization and other operations involved in RAG/Agent pipelines can be found on our Github repository.\nAuto-quantization of Voyage AI embeddings with MongoDB\nOur approach addresses the complete optimization cycle for vector search operations, covering:\nGenerating embeddings with quantization-aware models\nImplementing automatic vector quantization in MongoDB Atlas\nCreating and configuring specialized vector search indices\nMeasuring and comparing latency across different quantization strategies\nQuantifying representational capacity retention\nAnalyzing performance trade-offs between binary, scalar, and float32 implementations\nMaking evidence-based architectural decisions for production AI retrieval systems\nFigure 1. Vector quantization architecture with MongoDB Atlas and Voyage AI.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUsing text data as an example, we convert documents into numerical vector embeddings that capture semantic relationships. MongoDB then indexes and stores these embeddings for efficient similarity searches. By comparing queries run against float32, int8, and binary embeddings, you can gauge the trade-offs between precision and performance and better understand which quantization strategy best suits large-scale, high-throughput workloads.\nOne key takeaway from this article is that representational capacity retention is highly dependent on the embedding model used. With quantization-aware models like Voyage AI’s voyage-3-large at appropriate dimensionality (1024 dimensions), our tests demonstrate that we can achieve 95%+ recall retention at reasonable numCandidate values. This means organizations can significantly reduce memory and computational requirements while preserving semantic search quality, provided they select embedding models specifically designed to maintain their representation capacity after quantization.\nFor more information on why vector quantization is crucial for AI workloads, refer to this blog post.\nDataset information\nOur quantization evaluation framework leverages two complementary datasets designed specifically to benchmark semantic search performance across different precision levels.\nPrimary Dataset (Wikipedia-22-12-en-voyage-embed): Contains approximately 300,000 Wikipedia article fragments with pre-generated 1024-dimensional embeddings from Voyage AI’s voyage-3-large model. This dataset serves as a diverse vector corpus for testing vector quantization effects in semantic search. Throughout this tutorial, we'll use the primary dataset to demonstrate the technical implementation of quantization.\nEmbedding generation with Voyage AI\nFor generating new embeddings for AI Search applications, we use Voyage AI's voyage-3-large model, which is specifically designed to be quantization-aware. The voyage-3-large model generates 1024-dimensional vectors and has been specifically trained to maintain semantic properties even after quantization, making it ideal for our AI retrieval optimization strategy. For more information on how MongoDB and Voyage AI work together for optimal retrieval, see our previous article, Rethinking Information Retrieval with MongoDB and Voyage AI.\nimport voyageai\n\n# Initialize the Voyage AI client\nclient = voyageai.Client()\n\ndef get_embedding(text, task_prefix=\"document\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate embeddings using the voyage-3-large model for AI Retrieval.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        text (str): The input text to be embedded.\n        task_prefix (str): A prefix describing the task; this is prepended to the text.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: The embedding vector (1024 dimensions).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not text.strip():\n        print(\"Attempted to get embedding for empty text.\")\n        return []\n        \n    # Call the Voyage API to generate the embedding\n    result = client.embed([text], model=\"voyage-3-large\", input_type=task_prefix)\n    \n    # Return the first embedding from the result\n    return result.embeddings[0]\n\nConverting embeddings to BSON BinData format\nA critical optimization step is converting embeddings to MongoDB's BSON BinData format, which significantly reduces storage and memory requirements. The BinData vector format provides significant advantages:\nReduces disk space by approximately 3x compared to arrays\nEnables more efficient indexing with alternate types (int8, binary)\nReduces RAM usage by 3.75x for scalar and 24x for binary quantization\nfrom bson.binary import Binary, BinaryVectorDtype\n\ndef generate_bson_vector(array, data_type):\n    return Binary.from_vector(array, BinaryVectorDtype(data_type))\n\n# Convert embeddings to BSON BinData vector format\nwikipedia_data_df[\"embedding\"] = wikipedia_data_df[\"embedding\"].apply(\n    lambda x: generate_bson_vector(x, BinaryVectorDtype.FLOAT32)\n)\n\nVector index creation with different quantization strategies\nThe cornerstone of our performance optimization framework lies in creating specialized vector indices with different quantization strategies. This process leverages MongoDB for general-purpose database functionalities, more specifically, its high-performance vector database capabilities of efficiently handling million-scale embedding collections.\nThis implementation step focuses on how to set up MongoDB's vector search capabilities with automatic quantization, focusing on two primary quantization strategies: scalar (int8) and binary. Two indices are created to measure and evaluate the retrieval latency and recall performance of various precision data types, including the full fidelity vector representation.\nThe MongoDB database uses the vector index HNSW, which is a graph-based indexing algorithm that organizes vectors in a hierarchical structure of layers. In this structure, vector data points within a layer are contextually similar, while higher layers are sparse compared to lower layers, which are denser and contain more vector data points.\nThe code snippet below showcases the implementation of two quantization strategies in parallel; this enables the systematic evaluation of the latency, memory usage, and representational capacity trade-offs across the precision spectrum, enabling data-driven decisions about the optimal approach for specific application requirements.\nMongoDB Atlas automatic quantization is activated entirely through the vector index definition. By including the \"quantization\" attribute and setting its value to either \"scalar\" or \"binary\", you enable automatic compression of your embeddings at index creation time. This declarative approach means no separate preprocessing of vectors is required—MongoDB handles the dimensional reduction transparently while maintaining the original embeddings for potential rescoring operations.\nfrom pymongo.operations import SearchIndexModel\n\ndef setup_vector_search_index(collection, index_definition, index_name=\"vector_index\"):\n    \"\"\"Setup a vector search index with the specified configuration\"\"\"\n    ...\n# 1.

While LLMs provide reasoning and generation capabilities, vector search delivers the contextual knowledge necessary for grounding these capabilities in relevant information.\nThis semantic retrieval operation forms the backbone of RAG architectures that power enterprise-grade AI applications, such as knowledge-intensive chatbots and domain-specific assistants. In more advanced implementations, vector search enables agentic RAG systems where autonomous agents dynamically determine what information to retrieve, when to retrieve it, and how to incorporate it into complex reasoning chains.\nThe implementation below provides the technical overview that transforms raw embedding vectors into intelligent search components that move beyond lexical matching to true semantic understanding.\nOur implementation below supports both approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and exact nearest neighbor (ENN) search through the use_full_precision parameter:\nApproximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search: When use_full_precision = False, the system performs an approximate search using:\nThe specified quantized index (binary or scalar)\nThe HNSW graph navigation algorithm\nA controlled exploration breadth via numCandidates\nThis approach sacrifices perfect accuracy for dramatic performance gains, particularly at scale. The HNSW algorithm enables sub-linear time complexity by intelligently sampling the vector space, making it possible to search billions of vectors in milliseconds instead of seconds. When combined with quantization, ANN delivers order-of-magnitude improvements in both speed and memory efficiency.\nExact nearest neighbor (ENN) search: When use_full_precision = True, the system performs exact search using:\nThe original float32 embeddings (regardless of the index specified)\nAn exhaustive comparison approach\nThe exact = True directive to bypass approximation techniques\nENN guarantees finding the mathematically optimal nearest neighbors by computing distances between the query vector and every single vector in the database. This brute-force approach provides perfect recall but scales linearly with collection size, becoming prohibitively expensive as vector counts increase beyond millions.\nWe include both search modes for several critical reasons:\nEstablishing ground truth: ENN provides the \"perfect\" baseline against which we measure the quality degradation of approximation techniques. The representational retention metrics discussed later directly compare ANN results against this ENN ground truth.\nVarying application requirements: Not all AI applications prioritize the same metrics. Time-sensitive applications (real-time customer service) might favor ANN's speed, while high-stakes applications (legal document analysis) might require ENN's accuracy.\ndef custom_vector_search(\n    user_query,\n    collection,\n    embedding_path,\n    vector_search_index_name=\"vector_index\",\n    top_k=5,\n    num_candidates=25,\n    use_full_precision=False,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform vector search with configurable precision and parameters for AI Search applications.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate embedding for the query\n    query_embedding = get_embedding(user_query, task_prefix=\"query\")\n    \n    # Define the vector search stage\n    vector_search_stage = {\n        \"$vectorSearch\": {\n            \"index\": vector_search_index_name,\n            \"queryVector\": query_embedding,\n            \"path\": embedding_path,\n            \"limit\": top_k,\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Configure search precision approach\n    if not use_full_precision:\n        # For approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search\n        vector_search_stage[\"$vectorSearch\"][\"numCandidates\"] = num_candidates\n    else:\n        # For exact nearest neighbor (ENN) search\n        vector_search_stage[\"$vectorSearch\"][\"exact\"] = True\n    \n    # Project only needed fields\n    project_stage = {\n        \"$project\": {\n            \"_id\": 0,\n            \"title\": 1,\n            \"text\": 1,\n            \"wiki_id\": 1,\n            \"url\": 1,\n            \"score\": {\"$meta\": \"vectorSearchScore\"}\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Build and execute the pipeline\n    pipeline = [vector_search_stage, project_stage]\n    \n    ...\n    \n    # Execute the query\n    results = list(collection.aggregate(pipeline))\n    \n    return {\"results\": results, \"execution_time_ms\": execution_time_ms}\n\nMeasuring the retrieval latency of various quantized vectors\nIn production AI retrieval systems, query latency directly impacts user experience, operational costs, and system throughput capacity. Vector search operations typically constitute the primary performance bottleneck in RAG architectures, making latency optimization a critical engineering priority.\nSub-100ms response times are often necessary for interactive applications and mission-critical applications, while batch processing systems may tolerate higher latencies but require consistent predictability for resource planning.\nOur latency measurement methodology employs a systematic, parameterized approach that models real-world query patterns while isolating the performance characteristics of different quantization strategies. This parameterized benchmarking enables us to:\nConstruct detailed latency profiles across varying retrieval depths\nIdentify performance inflection points where quantization benefits become significant\nMap the scaling curves of different precision levels as the data volume increases\nDetermine optimal configuration parameters for specific throughput targets\ndef measure_latency_with_varying_topk(\n    user_query,\n    collection,\n    vector_search_index_name,\n    use_full_precision=False,\n    top_k_values=[5, 10, 50, 100],\n    num_candidates_values=[25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000],\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Measure search latency across different configurations.\n    \"\"\"\n    results_data = []\n\n    for top_k in top_k_values:\n        for num_candidates in num_candidates_values:\n            # Skip invalid configurations\n            if num_candidates < top_k:\n                continue\n\n            # Get precision type from index name\n            precision_name = vector_search_index_name.split(\"vector_index\")[1]\n            precision_name = precision_name.replace(\"quantized\", \"\").capitalize()\n            if use_full_precision:\n                precision_name = \"_float32_ENN\"\n\n            # Perform search and measure latency\n            vector_search_results = custom_vector_search(\n                user_query=user_query,\n                collection=collection,\n                embedding_path=\"embedding\",\n                vector_search_index_name=vector_search_index_name,\n                top_k=top_k,\n                num_candidates=num_candidates,\n                use_full_precision=use_full_precision,\n            )\n\n            latency_ms = vector_search_results[\"execution_time_ms\"]\n            \n            # Store results\n            results_data.append({\n                \"precision\": precision_name,\n                \"top_k\": top_k,\n                \"num_candidates\": num_candidates,\n                \"latency_ms\": latency_ms,\n            })\n            \n            print(f\"Top-K: {top_k}, NumCandidates: {num_candidates}, \" \n                  f\"Latency: {latency_ms} ms, Precision: {precision_name}\")\n\n    return results_data\n\nLatency results analysis\nOur systematic benchmarking reveals dramatic performance differences between quantization strategies across different retrieval scenarios. The visualizations below capture these differences for top-k=10 and top-k=100 configurations.\nFigure 2. Search latency vs the number candidates for top-k=10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 3. Search latency vs the number of candidates for top-k=100.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSeveral critical patterns emerge from these latency profiles:\nQuantization delivers exponential performance gains: The float32_ENN approach (purple line) demonstrates latency measurements an order of magnitude higher than any quantized approach. At top-k=10, ENN latency starts at ~1600ms and never drops below 500ms, while quantized approaches maintain sub-100ms performance until extremely high candidate counts. This performance gap widens further as data volume scales.\nScalar quantization offers the best performance profile: Somewhat surprisingly, scalar quantization (orange line) consistently outperforms both binary quantization and float32 ANN across most configurations. This is particularly evident at higher num_candidates values, where scalar quantization maintains near-flat latency scaling. This suggests scalar quantization achieves an optimal balance in the memory-computation trade-off for HNSW traversal.\nBinary quantization shows linear latency scaling: While binary quantization (red line) starts with excellent performance, its latency increases more steeply as num_candidates grows, eventually exceeding scalar quantization at very high exploration depths. This suggests that while binary vectors require less memory, their distance computation savings are partially offset by the need for more complex traversal patterns in the HNSW graph and rescoring.\nAll quantization methods maintain interactive-grade performance: Even with 10,000 candidate explorations and top-k=100, all quantized approaches maintain sub-200ms latency, well within interactive application requirements. This demonstrates that quantization enables order-of-magnitude increases in exploration depth without sacrificing user experience, allowing for dramatic recall improvements while maintaining acceptable latency.\nThese empirical results validate our theoretical understanding of quantization benefits and provide concrete guidance for production deployment: scalar quantization offers the best general-purpose performance profile, while binary quantization excels in memory-constrained environments with moderate exploration requirements.\nIn the images below we employ logarithmic scaling for both axes in our latency analysis because search performance data typically spans multiple orders of magnitude.\nWhen comparing different precision types (scalar, binary, float32_ann) across varying numbers of candidates, the latency values can range from milliseconds to seconds, while candidate counts may vary from hundreds to millions.\nLinear plots would compress smaller values and make it difficult to observe performance trends across the full range(as we see above). Logarithmic scaling transforms exponential relationships into linear ones, making it easier to identify proportional changes, compare relative performance improvements, and detect patterns that would otherwise be obscured.\nThis visualization approach is particularly valuable for understanding how each precision type scales with increasing workload and for identifying the optimal operating ranges where certain methods outperform others(as shown below).\nFigure 4. Search latency vs the number of candidates (log scale) for top-k=10.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 5. Search latency vs the number of candidates (log scale) for top-k=100.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe performance characteristics observed in the logarithmic plots above directly reflect the architectural differences inherent in binary quantization's two-stage retrieval process. Binary quantization employs a coarse-to-fine search strategy: an initial fast retrieval phase using low-precision binary representations, followed by a refinement phase that rescores the top-k candidates using full-precision vectors to restore accuracy.\nThis dual-phase approach creates a fundamental performance trade-off that manifests differently across varying candidate pool sizes. For smaller candidate sets, the computational savings from binary operations during the initial retrieval phase can offset the rescoring overhead, making binary quantization competitive with other methods. However, as the candidate pool expands, the rescoring phase—which must compute full-precision similarity scores for an increasing number of retrieved candidates—begins to dominate the total latency profile.\nMeasuring representational capacity retention\nWhile latency optimization is critical for operational efficiency, the primary concern for AI applications remains semantic accuracy. Vector quantization introduces a fundamental trade-off: computational efficiency versus representational capacity. Even the most performant quantization approach is useless if it fails to maintain the semantic relationships encoded in the original embeddings.\nTo quantify this critical quality dimension, we developed a systematic methodology for measuring representational capacity retention—the degree to which quantized vectors preserve the same nearest-neighbor relationships as their full-precision counterparts. This approach provides an objective, reproducible framework for evaluating semantic fidelity across different quantization strategies.\ndef measure_representational_capacity_retention_against_float_enn(\n    ground_truth_collection,\n    collection,\n    quantized_index_name,\n    top_k_values,\n    num_candidates_values,\n    num_queries_to_test=1,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compare quantized search results against full-precision baseline.\n    For each test query:\n    1.

A retention score of 1.0 indicates that the quantized search returns exactly the same results as the full-precision search, while lower scores indicate divergence.\nRepresentational capacity results analysis\nThe findings from the representational capacity retention evaluation provide empirical validation that properly implemented quantization—particularly scalar quantization—can maintain semantic fidelity while dramatically reducing computational and memory requirements.\nNote that in the chart below, the scalar curve (yellow) exactly matches the float32_ann performance (blue)—so much so that the blue line is completely hidden beneath the yellow. The near-perfect retention of scalar quantization should alleviate concerns about quality degradation, while binary quantization's retention profile suggests it's suitable for applications with higher performance demands that can tolerate slight quality trade-offs or compensate with increased exploration depth.\nFigure 6. Retention score vs the number of candidates for top-k=10.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 7. Retention score vs the number of candidates for top-k=50.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 8. Retention score vs the number of candidates for top-k=100.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nScalar quantization achieves near-perfect retention: The scalar quantization approach (orange line) demonstrates extraordinary representational capacity preservation, achieving 98-100% retention across nearly all configurations. At top-k=10, it reaches perfect 1.0 retention with just 100 candidates, effectively matching full-precision ENN results while using 4x less memory. This remarkable performance validates the effectiveness of int8 quantization when implemented with MongoDB's automatic quantization.\nBinary quantization shows retention-exploration trade-off: Binary quantization (red line) exhibits a clear correlation between exploration depth and retention quality. At top-k=10, it starts at ~91% retention with minimal candidates but improves to 98% at 500 candidates. The effect is more pronounced at higher top-k values (50 and 100), where initial retention drops to ~74% but recovers substantially with increased exploration. This suggests that binary quantization's information loss can be effectively mitigated by exploring more of the vector space.\nRetention dynamics change with retrieval depth: As top-k increases from 10 to 100, the retention patterns become more differentiated between quantization strategies. This reflects the increasing challenge of maintaining accurate rankings as more results are requested. While scalar quantization remains relatively stable across different top-k values, binary quantization shows more sensitivity, indicating it's better suited for targeted retrieval scenarios (low top-k) than for broad exploration.\nExploration depth compensates for precision loss: A fascinating pattern emerges across all quantization methods: increased num_candidates consistently improves retention. This demonstrates that reduced precision can be effectively counterbalanced by broader exploration of the vector space. For example, binary quantization at 500 candidates achieves better retention than scalar quantization at 25 candidates, despite using 32x less memory per vector.\nFloat32 ANN vs. scalar quantization: The float32 ANN approach (blue line) shows virtually identical retention to scalar quantization at higher top-k values, while consuming 4x more memory. This suggests scalar quantization represents an optimal balance point, offering full-precision quality with significantly reduced resource requirements.\nConclusion\nThis guide has demonstrated the powerful impact of vector quantization in optimizing vector search operations through MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and automatic quantization feature, using Voyage AI embeddings. These findings provide empirical validation that properly implemented quantization—particularly scalar quantization—can maintain semantic fidelity while dramatically reducing computational and memory requirements.\nThe near-perfect retention of scalar quantization should alleviate concerns about quality degradation, while binary quantization's retention profile suggests it's suitable for applications with higher performance demands that can tolerate slight quality trade-offs or compensate with increased exploration depth.\nBinary quantization achieves optimal latency and resource efficiency, particularly valuable for high-scale deployments where speed is critical.\nScalar quantization provides an effective balance between performance and precision, suitable for most production applications.\nFloat32 maintains maximum accuracy but incurs significant performance and memory costs.\nFigure 9. Performance and memory usage metrics for binary quantization, scalar quantization, and float32 implementation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBased on the image above our implementation demonstrated substantial efficiency gains:\nBinary Quantized Index achieves the most compact disk footprint at 407.66MB, representing approximately 4KB per document. This compression comes from representing high-dimensional vectors as binary bits, dramatically reducing storage requirements while maintaining retrieval capability.\nFloat32 ANN Index requires 394.73MB of disk space, slightly less than binary due to optimized index structures, but demands the full storage footprint be loaded into memory for optimal performance.\nScalar Quantized Index shows the largest storage requirement at 492.83MB (approximately 5KB per document), suggesting this method maintains higher precision than binary while still applying compression techniques, resulting in a middle-ground approach between full precision and extreme quantization.\nThe most striking difference lies in memory requirements. Binary quantization demonstrates a 23:1 memory efficiency ratio, requiring only 16.99MB in RAM versus the 394.73MB needed by float32_ann. Scalar quantization provides a 3:1 memory optimization, requiring 131.42MB compared to float32_ann's full memory footprint.\nFor production AI Retrieval implementation, general guidance is as follows:\nUse scalar quantization for general use cases requiring good balance of speed and accuracy.\nUse binary quantization for large-scale applications (1M+ vectors) where speed is critical.\nUse float32 only for applications requiring maximum precision, where accuracy is paramount.\nVector quantization becomes particularly valuable for databases exceeding 1M vectors, where it enables significant scalability improvements without compromising retrieval accuracy. When combined with MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes, this approach effectively addresses both cost and performance constraints in advanced vector search applications.\nBoost your MongoDB skills today through our Atlas Learning Hub.\nHead over to our quick start guide to get started with Atlas Vector Search.",

    "description": "Search is changing. Backlinks and keywords aren’t enough anymore. AI-first interfaces like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews now answer questions before users ever click a link (if at all). Large language models (LLMs) have become a new layer in the discovery process, reshaping how, where, and when content is seen.\nThis shift is changing how visibility works. It’s still early, and nobody has all the answers. But one pattern we're noticing is that LLMs tend to favor content that explains things clearly, deeply, and with structure.\n\"LLM SEO\" isn’t a replacement for traditional search engine optimization (SEO). It’s an adaptation. For marketers, content strategists, and product teams, this shift brings both risk and opportunity.

    "description": "嘉宾｜范冰，《增长黑客》作者，增长黑客AI周报（ZengZhang.AI），奶爸。\n\n欢迎收听新一期AI炼金术，今天请的嘉宾是范冰。我不光是他书的读者，后来我发现我总是会成为他的付费用户，因为他搭的系统、做的东西都特别精巧，总能让人心甘情愿地买单。所以这次我赶紧把他抓过来，让他亲口讲讲，这套让人上瘾的产品定位和信息到底是怎么做到的？更重要的是，有了孩子之后，他心态上有什么变化？我们又如何看待AI时代的育儿问题？希望你也能有所收获。\n\n「 关键结论 」\n效率革命：用 AI 写代码，可将过去数月的工作量压缩至三五天，效率提升10-20倍。\n反思自我：无论是用 AI 还是养娃，先搞清楚一个目标是自己的主观意愿，还是世界本该如此。\n产品之道：最好的产品，源于解决自己的真实痛点。\n育儿即训练：养娃就像训练大语言模型，本质是模仿和吸收，不是教育。家庭教育就像System Prompt。\n传播心法：把付费内容做成方便转发的形态，让付费用户成为你的最佳传播节点。\n\n「 行动指南 」\n系统搭建：按“流入-处理-输出”三步法搭建个人 AI 系统，先有框架再优化。\n引导方法：用孩子真正热爱的东西（如游戏攻略）去引导他学习和阅读。\n\n时间线：\n03:00 产品的魔力：为什么范冰做的东西总让人想买单？\n从不刻意“定位”，而是源于解决自身真实存在的痛点，比如每天需要过滤海量信息。\n他的 newsletter「ZengZhang.AI」订阅量已过万，秘诀在于聚焦于那些对信息品质有要求的少数人。\n曾为了宣传，范冰放出自己书籍的“盗版”，让真正的盗版无路可走。\n09:00 效率革命：从两个月到三五天，我的AI信息处理管道\n范冰搭建的“电子奏折”系统，个人信息处理流水线。\n信息流入：通过AI写代码，构建了一个能聚合 RSS、YouTube 字幕、Read-it-later 服务等多种信源的阅读器 。\n信息处理：AI 自动为文章打分，例如，内容客观、有正反方论证的加分；疑似公关稿、内容空洞的减分。\n信息输出：最终生成 newsletter 雏形、播客脚本、甚至朋友圈文案。\n19:00 范冰看好的三个未来方向\nAI增强人脑：与硬件结合，实现类似黑客帝国的脑后插管。\nAI + 玄学：“天作之合”，能让新一代年轻人用技术抢占话语权。\nAI + 投资：用 AI Agent 帮助普通人执行投资策略，战胜人性弱点。\n23:00 AI时代的育儿经：养娃，就像训练一个大语言模型\n任鑫分享“ROI无限高”的育儿妙招：让孩子从小只看英文版动画片。他认为，孩子学语言和AI模型一样，依赖的是海量数据灌输（模仿和吸收），而非规则教学。\n范冰：家庭教育就像是给孩子设置System Prompt，不同语言的输入，会塑造出孩子不同的性格特质，仿佛在训练一个“垂类模型” 。\n核心心法：不要强行灌输道理，而是要“投其所好”，用他感兴趣的内容（如游戏攻略、超级英雄读物）去引导，把责任还给孩子自己。\n36:00 与AI和解，也与自己和解\n无论是用AI编程还是养育小孩，本质都是一样的：你首先要搞清楚，这是你自己的主观意愿，还是世界本应如此。\n如果你需求不明，却要求外部（AI或孩子）达成你想要的结果，这本身就是“强人所难”。\n43:00 黑客奶爸的日常\n范冰 Hack 了自己的 Meta Ray-Ban 智能眼镜。\n抱着娃不方便操作时，可以直接对眼镜下达指令，触发家里的服务器执行预设好的脚本，完成记笔记、收集信息等任务，实现“带娃工作两不误”。\n\n欢迎订阅「AI 炼金术」的播客，以及同名公众号、视频号 \n「AI 炼金术」是一档由徐文浩和任鑫——两位多年老友、AI 领域的资深从业者——打造的播客。这里是探讨 AI 和创业的理想聚集地，我们会邀请一线创业者、产品产品和科研学者，深入探讨 AI 如何重塑行业、变革生活，以及如何从 0 到 1 打造 AI 原生产品。 \n我们的讨论会涵盖多个话题：从 AI 如何改变世界的未来，到如何找到 AI 创业的 PMF；从如何利用 AI 降本增效，到怎样将 AI 技术融入日常生活……如果你对 AI、产品、创业感兴趣，这里有满满的干货和一线实战经验，欢迎关注并推荐给你的朋友，共同探索未来的无限可能！ \n商务合作：公众号 「AI炼金术 」菜单栏中【商务】获取联系方式 \n\n节目主理人： \n徐文浩：某AI创业公司联合创始人，正在面向全球市场开发AI应用。连续创业者，参与过多家创业公司，拼多多早期员工。广告科技公司MediaV的算法和数据负责人，后被360收购。离开后加入成立不到1个月的拼多多。后创办了基于AI的海外客服聊天机器人公司 BotHub.AI 和 海外社交电商平台 Bukito 都宣告失败。2023年再次下场创业。 \n任鑫：云九资本合伙人，主要在投资和孵化面向全球市场的 AI 应用。之前是连续创业者，曾经打造“今夜酒店特价”用移动互联网应用特价销售酒店尾房；被京东并购后内部创业“京东到家”开展本地即时零售业务；2015 年再次创业 Get 探索对话式人工智能助理成为先烈；2021 年出售公司，2023 年重新回到 AI 世界。\n\nBGM：\n片头：Shortwire - Reconfig\n片尾：PRETTY YOUNG,Zack Hall - horizon",

    "description": "Grafana Play is a free and publicly accessible sandbox environment that allows users to explore and learn Grafana without setting up their own instance. Grafana Play comes preloaded with ready-made sample dashboards, and showcases how to work with different data sources, create visualizations, and use advanced Grafana features. \nOver the last decade or so, Grafana Play — which is hosted on\nGrafana Cloud — has become increasingly popular in the community, amassing thousands of public dashboards and users worldwide. With this growth came a great responsibility to ensure proper safeguards are in place to protect users’ personal information.\nAs part of these security and privacy efforts, we\nannounced plans earlier this year to delete inactive Grafana Play accounts. We know that data minimization is a cornerstone of protecting user privacy, and believe in only retaining data that serves a valid purpose to keep Play running for you. \nIn this follow-up post, we’ll provide a behind-the-scenes look at these efforts, detailing how we removed over 21,000 inactive users, as well as old and broken dashboards, in Grafana Play using basic Python, JavaScript, and\nGrafana k6. All code examples in this blog can also be found in this\npublic GitHub repository.\nDecluttering dashboards\nWith thousands of publicly available dashboards in Grafana Play, we would sometimes hear from community members who encountered a broken dashboard when they searched for a particular topic. These dashboards were often broken because of old data sources, or because they had not been generally maintained. \nIn most cases where we couldn’t contact the dashboard owner, or find a clear owner internally, we decided that fixing these dashboards would not be a viable solution. Instead, we deprecated them and hid them from public view. \nNOTE: If you notice your dashboard is not publicly available in Play anymore, you want it back up, and can assist in fixing it, we’re happy to work with you. Please reach out on our\ncommunity Slack and in the #grafana-play channel, provide us with a link to your dashboard, and we’ll help get it fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of Grafana k6\nFrom a tooling perspective, you might have heard of k6, our open source load testing tool. Grafana k6 supports various use cases that extend beyond load testing, including browser testing. While the Grafana API could provide us with a list of all dashboards on Play, there was no way for us to know which dashboards contained a broken panel on a protocol level. Since the broken panel element is rendered on the front end, we needed to use the\nk6 browser module to gain access to different browser-level APIs to interact with browsers and simulate user actions like navigating, clicking, and getting various DOM (Document Object Model) elements.\nHere’s a look at the k6 script we used.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nimport { check, sleep } from 'k6';\nimport { browser } from 'k6/browser';\nimport { Gauge } from 'k6/metrics';\nimport exec from 'k6/execution';\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nFirst, we imported various\nk6 modules, such as the browser module,\nGauge (a custom metric that you can create for tracking numeric values), the\nexec module to get information about the current test execution state inside the test script, and the\nhttp module to fetch dashboards from Play on a protocol level.\nIn our k6 setup function, we fetched dashboards from Play using an HTTP GET request, excluding folders as needed, and then returning the filtered dashboards.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nexport async function setup() {\nconst dashboards = await http.get('https://play.grafana.org/api/search?type=dash-db&limit=5000');\nconst urls = dashboards.json().filter(d => {\n// Exclude dashboards in folders that are used to replicate GitHub issues\n// These tend to naturally break after the issue is fixed, but teams have requirements\n// to keep them around to prevent them from littering GitHub issues with broken links.\nreturn (!(d.folderTitle === 'Bug reports reproduction') &&\n!(d.folderTitle === 'Replicating issues') &&\n!(d.folderTitle === 'dev-dashboards'))\n}).map(dashboard => ({\nurl: `https://play.grafana.org/d/${dashboard.uid}`,\ntitle: dashboard.title,\nfolderTitle: dashboard.folderTitle,\nuid: dashboard.uid,\n}))\nconsole.log(\"A total of\", urls.length, \"dashboards will be checked\")\nreturn { dashboards: urls };\n}\nOutside the setup function, we created a custom metric to record the number of broken panels per dashboard.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nconst brokenPanelsGauge = new Gauge('broken_panels');\nThen, for each dashboard, we leveraged the k6 browser testing functionality to find all broken panel elements in the DOM.\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nexport async function checkForBrokenPanels({ dashboards }) {\nconst page = await browser.newPage();\n// See https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-execution/#scenario\nif (exec.scenario.iterationInTest >= dashboards.length) {\nconsole.log(\"No more dashboards to check\")\nreturn\n}\n// Pick the dashboard for this iteration\nconst dashboard = dashboards[exec.scenario.iterationInTest];\nconst url = dashboard.url;\ntry {\nawait page.goto(url);\n// Wait for the time picker to confirm page load\nawait page.waitForSelector('[aria-controls=\"TimePickerContent\"]');\nsleep(2)\n// Look for broken panel elements in the DOM\nconst brokenPanels = await page.evaluate(() => {\nconst brokenPanels = document.querySelectorAll('button[data-testid=\"data-testid Panel status error\"]');\nreturn brokenPanels.length;\n});\n// Log result and record custom metric\nconsole.log(`ResultMeasurement,${dashboard.title},${dashboard.folderTitle},${dashboard.uid},${url},${brokenPanels}`)\nbrokenPanelsGauge.add(brokenPanels, { url: url });\ncheck(brokenPanels, {\n'Dashboard contains no broken panels': count => count === 0\n});\n} catch (error) {\nconsole.error(\"Error:\", error.message);\nconsole.error(error.stack);\n} finally {\nawait page.close();\n}\n}\nThe real magic here is looking for button[data-testid=\"data-testid Panel status error\"] in the DOM that comes back when the browser gets a copy of the dashboard. In the example of the broken dashboard we gave earlier, this button state indicates that the user would see a red icon indicating that the panel is broken.\nk6 can output custom metrics, so we were able to generate actual metrics and telemetry about the thousands of dashboards running on Play.  \nFor our initial cleanup effort, though, we exported the results to a CSV file and sorted the logs to deprecate the dashboards with the highest amount of broken panels. A similar test could easily be set up in\nGrafana Cloud k6 — the fully managed performance testing platform powered by k6 OSS — to monitor your dashboards on an ongoing basis.\nRemoving inactive users\nOur next step was to remove inactive users on Grafana Play. As mentioned above, and\nin a previous blog post, we wanted to do this so we don’t store personal identifiable information unnecessarily. We defined inactive users as those who met two criteria: they have not logged in for one year or more and they have never created dashboards or apps on Play.\nThis would be a lot of work to do by hand, so we wrote various scripts. To create our “active users list” — meaning a list of users we did not want to remove — we wrote scripts that enumerated every dashboard on Play, checked its edit history, and noted every user ID that has ever made a modification. \nLet’s break it down below.\nIdentifying active users \nTo build the active user list, we used\nJupyter Notebook and\nGoogle Colab to quickly run our code. Jupyter Notebook is an interactive, web-based environment used primarily for writing and running code, especially in Python. Google Colab is a cloud-hosted version of Jupyter Notebook provided by Google. \nWe first created a script that queried the Grafana /api/search endpoint to retrieve the dashboards’ unique identifier and stored it in a variable called uids. The token came from creating a\nservice account, which was used to authenticate against the Grafana API. \n\npython\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nfrom google.colab import userdata\nimport requests\nimport json\ntok = userdata.get('token')\ndef grafana_search():\nurl = \"https://play.grafana.org/api/search/\"\nparams = {\n\"type\": \"dash-db\",\n\"limit\": 5000\n}\ntry:\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer %s\" % tok})\nresponse.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes\nreturn response.json()\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\nprint(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nreturn None\nresults = grafana_search()\nuids = [r['uid'] for r in results]\nOnce we had all the unique identifiers for all dashboards, the next step was to check which users edited a dashboard, how often they made edits, and when they last edited it to give us an idea of who our most active users are. This was achieved with the following code.\n\npython\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nfrom google.colab import userdata\ntok = userdata.get('token')\nimport pandas as pd\nframe = {\n\"author\": [],\n\"versions\": [],\n\"latest\": []\n}\nheaders = {\n\"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + tok\n}\ncache = {}\nlimit = 2000\nx=0\nfor uid in uids:\nx = x + 1\nif x >= limit: break\nif x % 10 == 0:\nprint(\"Request %d\" % x)\nresponse = requests.get(f\"https://play.grafana.org/api/dashboards/uid/{uid}/versions\", headers=headers)\ntry:\nj = response.json()\nversions = j['versions']\nexcept KeyError:\nprint(\"Failed versions on %s\" % json.dumps(j))\nversions = []\nfor version in versions:\ncreatedBy = version['createdBy']\ncreated = version['created']\nif not createdBy in cache:\ncache[createdBy] = { \"latest\": created, \"versions\": 1 }\nelse:\ncache[createdBy]['versions'] = cache[createdBy]['versions'] + 1\nif cache[createdBy]['latest'] < created:\ncache[createdBy]['latest'] = created\nfor author in cache:\nframe[\"author\"].append(author)\nframe[\"versions\"].append(cache[author]['versions'])\nframe[\"latest\"].append(cache[author]['latest'])\ndf = pd.DataFrame(frame)\ndf.to_csv(path + \"/dashboard-authors-summarized-stats.csv\", index=False)\nEssentially, we iterated over the dashboard identifiers and fetched the version history. For each saved version of the dashboard, we extracted the createdBy (the user who saved the dashboard) and the created (when they saved it) fields. We then added the new user information to the cache. If the user already existed in the cache, we incremented the version count. Finally, we saved the results as a CSV file.\nIdentifying inactive users\nThe next step for us was to build a list of inactive users by comparing our previous list with all the Play users. Again, an “inactive user” is one who has not logged in for one year or more and has never created dashboards or apps on Play.\nWe wanted to be sure not to delete any account that had created a dashboard, since this would destroy the attribution metadata on the dashboard. \nThe active list: all user IDs who had ever contributed or modified a dashboard. We don’t want to delete these!\nThe full list: all Grafana Play users, period.\nThe inactive list: (full list) - (active list)\nOnce we had the list of inactive users, the next step was to delete them. Here is an example code snippet that read the user IDs one by one from an Excel sheet, called the relevant Grafana API endpoint for the user, and invoked a delete action:\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nconst baseUrl = \"https://play.grafana.org/api/org/users/\";\nconst token = process.env.TOKEN;\nfor (const row of data) {\nconst userId = row.userId;\nif (userId) {\nconst url = `${baseUrl}${encodeURIComponent(userId)}`;\nconsole.log(url);\ntry {\nconst response = await axios.delete(baseUrl, {\nheaders: {\n'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,\n}\n});\nconsole.log(`Deleted user ${userId}: ${response.status}`);\n} catch (error) {\nconsole.error(`Error deleting user ${userId}: ${error.message}`);\n}\n}\n}\nBefore doing the mass deletion, we liaised with multiple teams to ensure we’d taken all necessary precautions. For example, we did thorough checks to ensure that any users who were removed can still log back in to Play in the future if they wish, and also to check that they can access other Grafana instances.\nToday, we have successfully removed over 21,000 inactive users from Play. This should not impact viewing permissions or compromise anyone’s access to anything, as Play remains a public playground to learn about Grafana, no login required. \nWrapping up — and how to contribute\nThe code examples above are basic scripts that you can convert to any programming language (apart from the k6 script). Here at Grafana Labs, these scripts helped us declutter our Grafana Play instance and clear out unnecessary data, making it more secure. If you want to try this with your Grafana instance, you can familiarize yourself with the\nGrafana API,\nGrafana k6 browser module, and\nservice accounts. \nIn addition, if you want to become an active contributor to Grafana Play, we hope to hear from you. We love to host community dashboards that demonstrate fun and unique ways to use Grafana, whether it’s\nplaying video games or\nmonitoring the US electrical grid. We encourage you to share your dashboard ideas, and would love to discuss showcasing them on Play.\nLastly, we’ve created a dedicated channel within our\ncommunity Slack, #grafana-play, for discussions specifically about Play. Please join the conversation to share feedback, ask questions, or clarify anything related to our new policy. \nThank you for being a part of the Grafana Play community and helping us maintain this valuable resource for learning and sharing dashboard expertise!",

    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/innovation/enhancing-ai-observability-mongodb-and-langtrace",
    "description": "Building high-performance AI applications isn’t just about choosing the right models—it’s also about understanding how they behave in real-world scenarios. Langtrace offers the tools necessary to gain deep insights into AI performance, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.\nSan Francisco-based Langtrace AI was founded in 2024 with a mission of providing cutting-edge observability solutions for AI-driven applications. While still in its early stages, Langtrace AI has rapidly gained traction in the developer community, positioning itself as a key player in AI monitoring and optimization. Its open-source approach fosters collaboration, enabling organizations of all sizes to benefit from advanced tracing and evaluation capabilities.\nThe company’s flagship product, Langtrace AI, is an open-source observability tool designed for building applications and AI agents that leverage large language models (LLMs). Langtrace AI enables developers to collect and analyze traces and metrics, optimizing performance and accuracy. Built on OpenTelemetry standards, Langtrace AI offers real-time tracing, evaluations, and metrics for popular LLMs, frameworks, and vector databases, with integration support for both TypeScript and Python.\nBeyond its core observability tools, Langtrace AI is continuously evolving to address the challenges of AI scalability and efficiency. By leveraging OpenTelemetry, the company ensures seamless interoperability with various observability vendors. Its strategic partnership with MongoDB enables enhanced database performance tracking and optimization, ensuring that AI applications remain efficient even under high computational loads.\nLangtrace AI's technology stack\nLangtrace AI is built on a streamlined—yet powerful—technology stack, designed for efficiency and scalability. Its SDK integrates OpenTelemetry libraries, ensuring tracing without disruptions. On the backend, MongoDB works with the rest of their tech stack, to manage metadata and trace storage effectively. For the client-side, Next.js powers the interface, utilizing cloud-deployed API functions to deliver robust performance and scalability.\nFigure 1.  How Langtrace AI uses MongoDB Atlas to power AI traceability and feedback loops\n\n\n\n\n \n\n“We have been a MongoDB customer for the last three years and have primarily used MongoDB as our metadata store. Given our longstanding confidence in MongoDB's capabilities, we were thrilled to see the launch of MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and quickly integrated it into our feedback system, which is a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) architecture that powers real-time feedback and insights from our users. Eventually, we added native support to trace MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to not only trace our feedback system but also to make it natively available to all MongoDB Atlas Vector Search customers by partnering officially with MongoDB.” Karthik Kalyanaraman, Co Founder and CTO, Langtrace AI.\nUse cases and impact\nThe integration of Langtrace AI with MongoDB has proven transformative for developers using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. As highlighted in Langtrace AI's MongoDB partnership announcement, our collaboration equips users with the tools needed to monitor and optimize AI applications, enhancing performance by tracking query efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and improving model accuracy. The partnership enhances observability within the MongoDB ecosystem, facilitating faster, more reliable application development.\nIntegrating MongoDB Atlas with advanced observability tools like Langtrace AI offers a powerful approach to monitoring and optimizing AI-driven applications. By tracing every stage of the vector search process—from embedding generation to query execution—MongoDB Atlas provides deep insights that allow developers to fine-tune performance and ensure smooth, efficient system operations.\nTo explore how Langtrace AI integrates with MongoDB Atlas for real-time tracing and optimization of vector search operations, check out this insightful blog by Langtrace AI, where they walk through the process in detail.\nOpportunities for growth and the evolving AI ecosystem\nLooking ahead, Langtrace AI is excited about the prospects of expanding the collaboration with MongoDB. As developers craft sophisticated AI agents using MongoDB Atlas, the partnership aims to equip them with the advanced tools necessary to fully leverage these powerful database solutions. Together, both companies support developers in navigating increasingly complex AI workflows efficiently.\nAs the AI landscape shifts towards non-deterministic systems with real-time decision-making, the demand for advanced observability and developer tools intensifies. MongoDB is pivotal in this transformation, providing solutions that optimize AI-driven applications and ensuring seamless development as the ecosystem evolves.\nExplore further\nInterested in learning more about Langtrace AI and MongoDB partnership?\nDiscover the enriching capabilities Langtrace AI brings to developers within the MongoDB ecosystem.\nLearn about tracing MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with Langtrace AI to improve AI model performance.\nAccess comprehensive documentation for integrating Langtrace AI with MongoDB Atlas.\nStart enhancing your AI applications today and experience the power of optimized observability.\nTo learn more about building AI-powered apps with MongoDB, check out our AI Learning Hub and stop by our Partner Ecosystem Catalog to read about our integrations with MongoDB’s ever-evolving AI partner ecosystem.",

    "description": "本期读的是著名日本纪录片导演想田和弘写的《这世上的偶然》。顾名思义，这是一本关于偶然性的书 — 它的美、它的必要性、它所揭露的生命的本质。这也是导演在探寻和思考纪录片是什么，自己为什么被纪录片如此深深吸引的书。\n\n作为创作者，我从书中得到了非常非常多的启发。从跟着作者一起憎恶“脚本至上主义”和“易懂性至上主义”，到对自己的反省和提醒；从怎么拍vlog — 拍什么，为什么拍，怎么呈现，到怎么写作、采访、主持、做播客；从垃圾剧为什么垃圾，到以真人为拍摄对象的某些综艺节目之“恶”，再到在“迎合”受众上如何找到平衡。我觉得从本书中获得的创作启发，比我从所有“写作/创作指导”类书中得到的都要多。\n\n抛开创作者的身份不谈，我也从本书中重新获得了“活在当下”的力量，甚至第一次明白了什么是“去感受”，什么是真正的“当下”。这本书彻底改变了我对纪录片的印象，让我第一次真正理解，纪录片不可取代的魅力在哪里，也改变了我对当下的理解，让我第一次真正明白，活在当下的意义是什么。我觉得这些是作为理解人类、理解人类的体验和生活的经验的《人类使用说明书》，非常有必要收录的一个篇章。\n\n希望大家能喜欢今天的节目，我们评论区见～\n\n---------------------------\n\n欢迎在以下平台关注我们：\n\n携隐Melody：小红书🍠 | 微博🧣 | 即刻🟡 | 公众号💚\n\n纵横四海：小红书🍠 | 微博🧣 | 即刻🟡\n\n---------------------------\n\n📝 时间轴\n\n  \n05:48 想田和弘是谁？\n  \n09:01 观察电影和它的代表人物怀斯曼\n  \n17:07 《和平》：一个偶然的拍摄故事\n  \n32:07 纪录片恶习一：脚本至上主义\n  \n40:43 主题是\"事后发现\"的 & 写作最大的问题\n  \n50:12 纪录片恶习二：易懂性至上主义\n  \n52:30 垃圾剧为什么垃圾\n  \n1:04:16 我拍vlog的收获和感悟\n  \n1:17:02 纪录片是客观的吗？\n  \n1:23:31 纪录片是中立的吗？\n  \n1:29:58 纪录片是真实的吗？\n  \n1:32:39 纪录片之恶 & 《再见爱人》\n  \n1:42:06 Ignorance 傲慢的无知\n  \n1:49:32 偶然的艺术\n  \n1:59:21 回到当下、感受当下三部曲\n  \n2:12:04 植月：关于残障人士的对话\n  \n2:19:20 岳母的不满：无处不在的女性困境\n  \n2:24:49 流浪猫：我们在替谁承担指责？\n  \n2:28:19 桥本先生：男人的价钱是一钱五厘\n  \n2:33:42 岳母和首相：serendipity\n  \n2:36:14 为什么要拍纪录片 & 《夏目友人帐》\n\n\n🎙️感谢Nobaton诺巴顿对本期节目的赞助\n\nNobaton诺巴顿，源自好莱坞明星私房院线口腔品牌，注重植物成分与专业科学高效进阶护理，被圈内人誉为 “红毯发光牙膏”。众多明星推荐，一站式解决牙黄、口臭、牙敏、牙龈脆弱等口腔问题。\n\n《纵横四海》的听众拥有专属福利优惠和 “纵横四海” 限量联名周边，以下方式均可获得：\n\n1、点击链接：诺巴顿店铺\n\n2、复制淘口令：39￥t0TBVpQvGQz￥  HU006\n\n3、在 “Nobaton海外旗舰店” 找客服报暗号：纵横四海\n\n领取比大促还优惠的大额专属优惠券。\n\n“纵横四海” 的联名明信片、帆布袋等限量周边，购买指定产品就赠送噢。",

    "description": "Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust today announced the appointment of Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, as a new member of the Trust. The Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT) is an independent body designed to help Anthropic achieve its public benefit mission.\nFontaine brings extensive government experience, including roles at the National Security Council, in the State Department, on Capitol Hill, and, for four years, on the Defense Policy Board. At a time when advanced AI systems increasingly impact national security, his appointment addresses the growing intersection between AI capabilities and geopolitical risks.\nBuddy Shah, Chair of the Long-Term Benefit Trust, said: “As the LTBT continues to mature, Richard's extensive national security experience brings critical perspective to help guide Anthropic through the complex challenges of increasingly powerful AI and its impact on global security.”\nAnthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission of ensuring a safe transition through transformative AI. The LTBT helps Anthropic achieve this public benefit mission by selecting members of Anthropic's Board of Directors, and advising the Board and leadership on how the company can maximize the benefits of advanced AI and mitigate its risks. New Trustees are selected by existing Trustees, in consultation with Anthropic, and have no financial stake in Anthropic. The Trust’s composition reflects a recognition that transformative AI will affect more than technology or business: it will reshape fundamental aspects of human society, from global health to international security to the basic functioning of democratic institutions.\nRichard Fontaine said: “With transformative AI on the near-term horizon, companies must consider the profound implications for everything we care about, including our security, our jobs, and our human interactions. My conversations with Dario, Daniela, and the LTBT team made clear that Anthropic takes these challenges seriously. As the stakes get higher, the LTBT serves as a valuable mechanism to help Anthropic’s leadership navigate critical decisions. I am pleased to lend my expertise to this important work.”\nFontaine’s appointment adds deep foreign policy and national security experience to the Trust’s range of expertise, reflecting Anthropic’s commitment to supporting democracy and global stability as a core pillar of its mission.\n“Richard’s expertise comes at a critical time as advanced AI capabilities increasingly intersect with national security considerations,” said Dario Amodei, CEO and Co-founder of Anthropic. “I've long believed that ensuring democratic nations maintain leadership in responsible AI development is essential for both global security and the common good. Richard’s appointment strengthens the Trust’s ability to guide Anthropic through the complex decisions that will shape not just our industry, but the global balance of power.”",

    "description": "今天，外媒曝光了一则消息：亚马逊正在秘密研发人形机器人，The humanoid robot可以直接将包裹送到你的家门口。这批人形机器人已经开始测试，预计不久就会上线。\n\n据曝光，这批人形机器人的视觉模型来自阿里Qwen-VL和DeepSeek-VL2。\n\n只能说，亚马逊选对了。\n\n机器人与真实世界交互，很考验模型的视觉理解能力。而阿里的Qwen-VL系列模型在全球下载量超过3200万次，曾在13项权威评测中夺得视觉理解冠军，是全球AI社区最受欢迎的开源模型。\n\n不仅如此，阿里还有全球顶尖的视觉推理模型QVQ和全模态模型Qwen-Omni，可以让机器人“看懂”真实世界的同时，还能与真实世界“互动”。\n\n不得不说，在开源生态这条路上，阿里确实遥遥领先。上个周，黄仁勋就对阿里大加赞扬，直言中国的Qwen和DeepSeek是全球最好的开源模型，最终赢得AI开发者的平台将赢得AI的未来。\n\n阿里AI正在成为行业的默认选型，成为“技术派的共同答案”。",

    "description": "🏃‍♀️ 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活。我是雨白。\n\n这期节目，我特别开心地请来了肖小跑老师。她的播客还有公众号文章，我一直都在追。小跑老师的知识密度、行动力和跨国调研的视角，在我看来特别宝贵。在之前的「投资大师系列」里，我们就已经和跑师一起聊过瑞·达利欧、吉姆·西蒙斯，但一直没有请她来聊一聊她自己，这期终于如愿了。\n\n前段时间，我看到跑师写了一篇文章，讲她带着一批东南亚企业家去新疆调研，标题是《“比较优势已死”的年代如何和盟友正确共生？》。文章里的一个企业家，最后问出一句话：“中国还有什么是需要别人的？”我当时就被击中了。这让我意识到：我们是不是太习惯站在强者视角去理解世界，而忽略了那些看起来「没有选择的人」，TA 们怎么看待局势，又怎么活下去。\n\n于是我们决定做这样一期节目——从非主流视角切入，看一看那些不在镁光灯下的角色：边缘的国家、被冲击的产业、以及正在被动应对世界巨变的个体。他们也许不是中心玩家，但这些人的选择与策略，有时甚至悄悄改变了格局的走向。\n\n跑师曾长期工作和生活在东南亚，目前常驻中国香港，她对这些「容易被忽略的角色」有着非常细腻的观察与共情。而这些，从更宏观地看，也许恰恰能够帮助我们理解——作为普通人，作为不总站在聚光灯下的「小角色」，在这场变化之中，我们还能怎么做判断、做选择，留住主动权。\n\n这是一期知识密度很高、又充满人情味的节目。节目中我们也提到了一个小小预告：我们的「投资大师系列」（暂定名）将作为一个正式专题大概率在 6 月 18 日和大家见面，这期节目也算是给几位老师施加点压力。我们都很喜欢这期节目，希望你能从中收获一些新的理解和视角。\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n肖小跑：开泰银行中国首席经济师、研究中心主任，上海交大高金智库研究员，播客：文理两开花、发现叙事、墙裂坛；公众号：肖小跑。\n\n🪁 时间轴\n\n04:02 零八年次贷危机，人人讨打的金融毕业生小跑准备去泰国海边躺平，却转身成了当地银行的香饽饽？\n\n08:56 跑来跑去的小跑老师：从泰国到香港，从银行工作到创业，从量化交易到专注新兴市场的宏观研究\n\n18:05 特朗普一作妖，新兴市场又火起来了？常年蜗居聚光灯之外的小国们，托起了大国博弈的拳击擂台 🥊\n\n22:51  竹子外交：白天效忠日军，晚上接待美军，令人看不起的「墙头草」，东南亚小国引以为傲的生存之道\n\n29:45 旧指标与新世界：从罗斯福新政后就没怎么变过的宏观研究框架，是否还能有效分析近百年后的当下？\n\n35:33 重新理解「比较优势」：从猎鹿博弈到囚徒博弈，亚当斯密的自由贸易理论，过时了？\n\n44:02 实地调研：从国企到民营中型企业、不同生产链条上的中国企业主们，都是如何看待、应对关税战的？\n\n51:38 看「天」吃饭的企业主，实战中的宏观经济学家：拜登和特朗普刚辩论完，我的美国客户立马给我打来电话：你们必须要走\n\n65:55 GDP之外的同理心经济学：人民的幸福感、年轻人对未来的希望，这些在宏观经济框架中都没有衡量指标，却必须要有人看到\n\n69:17 非主流视角中的获利机会：只做正统研究，只看主流叙事的人们，已经错过了泡泡玛特，也看不懂 Labubu\n\n73:45 以史为镜：三十年前出海的日本商人，是如何应对不同文化制度下的本地化危机的？\n\n87:10 个体的选择：人一定要先抛掉对安全感的追求，才能得到安全感\n\n93:47 从同理心经济学出发，用最前沿的技术关注更细节的角落，试图设计一个更好的社会生活经济框架\n\n🥂\n\n在诸位听友的支持下，知行小酒馆马上就要做到 200 期啦，我们准备制作一期特别节目，怀着轻松愉悦的心情，聊一聊和大家一起走过的这 200 期。\n\n关于小酒馆，你有什么好奇的问题？又或者，有些话想告诉我们很久了，但一直没机会说。趁着这个机会，都写下来吧！\n\n你的提问或分享，有可能会出现在我们的节目之中。欢迎你扫码参与问卷，或点击链接，共创属于我们的纪念时刻！干杯！\n\n✏️ 猜你想看\n\n04:55 次贷危机：指 2007 年在美国爆发并在全球范围内引起巨大震荡的金融危机。这一次危机以美国第二大次级房贷公司新世纪金融公司破产事件为「标志」，由房地产市场蔓延到信贷市场，许多大型金融机构进而倒闭，最终演变为了全球性金融危机。\n\n12:13 811会改：2015年8月11日，中国央行宣布调整人民币对美元汇率中间价报价机制，这一调整使得人民币兑美元汇率中间价机制进一步市场化，更加真实地反映了当期外汇市场的供求关系。\n\n12:46 中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）：自称日裔美国人。其名字没有官方汉字写法，有些日本媒体写为中本哲史。此人是比特币协议及其相关软件 Bitcoin-Qt 的创造者，但真实身份未知。\n\n31:09  罗斯福新政：是指1933年富兰克林·罗斯福就任美国总统后实行的一系列经济政策，核心是三个R：救济（Relief）、复兴（Recovery）和改革（Reform），因此亦称三R新政。“新政”于1933年-1938年实行，“救济”针对穷人与失业者，“复兴”是将经济恢复到正常水准，“改革”针对金融系统，预防再次发生大萧条。\n\n相关节目\n\nE164 吉姆·西蒙斯：征服市场的人\n\nE150 瑞·达利欧的A面与B面\n\nE23 海外投资:中国已经是新兴市场了，其它新兴市场还有必要投吗?\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 肖小跑｜主持 雨白｜后期 甜食｜制作 星星 雨烨｜单集封面 Recraft\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。\n\n全文完，祝扎实生活 🌱",

    "description": "AI不仅在重塑技术，也在重塑人类。\n\n当大语言模型成为“行为捕捉器”，当算法开始定义人类情感，技术狂欢背后，有着信任、等等一系列的古典命题。AI到底对我们当下的生活意味着什么？如果AI技术成为主流，我们要如何面对技术种姓制的潜在风险？人类的历史是否只能“加速”而无法“对齐”？\n\n本期内容来自狂喜播客节的一场现场对话。三位社会学背景的主播嘉宾笑称自己身处一个“赛博古典乐园”，和大家聊聊AI的古典时代疯狂史。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n何必：北京大学历史学博士\n\n孟庆延：大观学者，中国政法大学社会学院教授\n\n孙哲：「社会学人DAO」主播，上海财经大学经济社会学系副教授\n\n【收听指南】\n\n01:28 从生活的角度看AI，而不是从AI的角度看生活\n\n07:51 在“赛博古典乐园”，你可以“断网”、可以“走心”\n\n11:52 从比特币到AI，技术背后是很古典的信任问题\n\n16:18 大语言模型，更确切的说法可能是“大行为模型”\n\n20:03 听其言、观其行，也未必能真正理解人的内心\n\n23:32 AI回应了现代人的焦虑，但也在重新塑造人类\n\n26:21 AI背后的技术精英，与技术种姓制的潜在风险\n\n35:49 这个时代是“加速”还是“对齐”，答案在惯习里\n\n41:49 从历史上看，人类都在加速，而从未对齐过\n\n44:35 人的符号化——“元宇宙会让笛卡尔笑醒”\n\n49:12 好的社科研究者，某种意义上可以预言未来\n\n51:23 技术加速主义一旦出现，人类根本无法逃脱\n\n55:39 AI可以提供情绪价值，但无法真正产生情感\n\n01:01:12 理解不是一个计算过程，而是犯错的过程\n\n01:05:55 提问：AI已经这样了，人类还能做些什么？\n\n01:08:47 提问：AI会取代宗教吗？\n\n01:17:34 提问：AI的拒绝来自于AI的判断还是幕后管理者的阻挡？\n\n【工具箱】\n\n01 关于节目中提到的“加速”与“对齐”指代的是AI创新理念之争：\n\n加速主义（Accelerationism）是一种政治与社会理论，认为资本主义制度或历史上某种技术相关的社会进程应该被急剧强化，以产生巨大社会变革。加速主义也可能指更广泛的支持资本主义的深化的观点，这些论点认为这将加速资本主义自我毁灭的倾向，并最终导致其崩溃。\n\n超级对齐（Super Alignment）则是一种确保人工智能系统的行为与人类价值观和目标高度一致的技术和方法论。随着AI技术的发展，尤其是在决策能力和自主性方面，确保它们的行动不会偏离人类的最佳利益变得尤为重要。\n\n02 本期提到的作品：\n\n[法] 米歇尔·福柯：《古典时代疯狂史》（《疯癫与文明》）\n\n[美] 查尔斯·赖特·米尔斯：《社会学的想象力》\n\n[德] 格奥尔格·齐美尔：《货币哲学》\n\n[英] 约翰·洛克：《政府论》\n\n[以] 尤瓦尔·赫拉利：《未来简史》\n\n[德] 马克斯·韦伯：《新教伦理与资本主义精神》\n\n【东腔西调相关内容专题】\n\n思想季：不要温和地走进那个元宇宙\n\n社会病理学：社会有病，我们有药吗？\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台找到我们。欢迎关注、评论、转发，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：media@eidos.wiki",

    "description": "欢迎来到新一期《AI炼金术》，这是任鑫Mars的一期单口。\n作为CEO或者创业者，是否想拥抱 AI 却不知从何下手？觉得 AI 落地太复杂，公司动不起来？别纠结了，先从自己开始，你自己可以从哪儿入手，能做哪些事儿？你可以立刻动手做的十件事，帮你建立AI真实体感！\n\n「 关键结论 」\n核心是用起来：别只提升认知却不行动，关键在于实际使用。\nAI 应用闭环体验：做自媒体更新20条内容，能完整体验AI在商业上的应用。\nAgent 标准：不在于设计多好，而在于能否100%完成你的任务；公司遇到问题就一定会用它。\n体感至上：别光看不练，先建立真实的使用体感，每天和 AI 互动。\n统一思想不如统一提示词：公司要统一思想，共享提示词是最好的方法。\n\n时间线：\n0:02:31 第一件事：下载热门AI应用，先用起来！ \n点开热门 AI 应用玩个遍，建立最初的 AI 体感。\n进阶版： 把至少两个AI应用放在手机导航栏，时刻提醒自己多用！\n\n0:05:36 第二件事：购买海外一线AI工具会员，体验顶尖水平！ \n强烈建议购入ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini等AI工具的付费账号。用最好的工具，感受最前沿的技术。\n小贴士： B站搜索购买教程，或在公司内部寻求帮助。也可以试试Poe或Monica这类集合了多种大模型的工具。\n\n0:08:12 第三件事：至少体验三次Deep Research功能，让AI成为你的情报官！ \n尝试 Deep Research 功能，它能主动进行大量信息收集，并从不同角度深入挖掘。尤其适合研究你不熟悉的领域，比如市场格局调研、新兴企业分析、AI与本行业结合的应用场景等。还可以用它来学习别人已交过的“学费”，完善你的创业点子。 \n\n0:11:53 第四件事：用AI辅助学习，效率倍增！ \n将你想学习的内容（如YouTube频道、文章）丢给AI，告诉它你的学习目标，让AI帮你筛选重点、总结方法论、提炼案例。\n进阶版： 发现有价值的内容后，让AI帮你深挖作者的更多相关思想，将学到的知识应用于你的实际工作。 \n\n\n\n0:15:16 第五件事：创建你的第一个AI智能体（Agent）\n不要被“Agent”概念吓到，最简单的Agent就是一段存下来的、可复用的提示词。试试在豆包里创建一个，比如笔记助手，让它帮你总结知识点、案例，甚至反驳你的笔记以拓宽思路。\n真实案例： 创建一个翻译Agent，帮你润色英文，或将中文自然地翻译成口语化英文。还可以创建“奇异博士”这样的决策参谋Agent，帮你从多角度审视决策。\n\n0:19:30 第六件事：学会录音，并用AI处理录音稿，获取额外视角！ \n开会时使用通义千问等工具进行实时记录，或将会后录音转写成文字。将文字稿交给AI（如Gemini, ChatGPT），让它帮你生成会议纪要。\n更重要的是： 会议录音是宝贵的上下文信息。将包含大量公司讨论的录音稿喂给AI，能让AI更了解你的业务，从而在战略分析、复盘反思时给出更精准的建议。 \n\n0:22:00 第七件事：开设一个自媒体账号，并更新20条内容，倒逼自己深度使用AI！ \n定下更新20条内容的目标，你将不得不依赖AI。 从定位、用户分析、AI工具选择到内容生产、复盘迭代，完整体验一遍AI在商业上的应用闭环。\n半AI模式： 像AI炼金术播客一样，先人工对谈，再用 AI 剪辑并生成长文。\n全AI模式： 利用 AI 生成系列内容，如“听懂一百篇AI经典论文”或“拆解100个AI明星产品”播客，从选题、研究到内容生成，大部分由 AI 完成。\n\n0:27:06 第八件事：打造一个工作中真正会用到的Agent，实现100%任务替代\n将你的工作拆解成具有明确输入、处理流程和输出模块。 挑选重复性的模块，尝试制作能100%替代你这部分工作的Agent。\n\n0:30:00 第九件事：撰写一个超长的“母提示词”（Stone Prompt），让AI更懂你\n写下几千字的个人介绍，AI了解你越多，给出的回答质量就越高。\n延伸思考： 公司层面也可以统一核心价值观的“母提示词”，各部门再继承并加入自身偏好，实现“提示词对齐”，这才是最好的统一思想。 核心在于告诉AI那些“它不知道，但你知道”的上下文信息。 \n\n0:35:41 第十件事：行动起来，并在公司内部做一次分享\n用 AI 关键在于建立真实体感，而不是停留在认知层面。 \n\n\n欢迎订阅「AI 炼金术」的播客，以及同名公众号、视频号 \n「AI 炼金术」是一档由徐文浩和任鑫——两位多年老友、AI 领域的资深从业者——打造的播客。这里是探讨 AI 和创业的理想聚集地，我们会邀请一线创业者、产品产品和科研学者，深入探讨 AI 如何重塑行业、变革生活，以及如何从 0 到 1 打造 AI 原生产品。 \n我们的讨论会涵盖多个话题：从 AI 如何改变世界的未来，到如何找到 AI 创业的 PMF；从如何利用 AI 降本增效，到怎样将 AI 技术融入日常生活……如果你对 AI、产品、创业感兴趣，这里有满满的干货和一线实战经验，欢迎关注并推荐给你的朋友，共同探索未来的无限可能！ \n商务合作：公众号 「AI炼金术 」菜单栏中【商务】获取联系方式 \n\n节目主理人： \n徐文浩：某AI创业公司联合创始人，正在面向全球市场开发AI应用。连续创业者，参与过多家创业公司，拼多多早期员工。广告科技公司MediaV的算法和数据负责人，后被360收购。离开后加入成立不到1个月的拼多多。后创办了基于AI的海外客服聊天机器人公司 BotHub.AI 和 海外社交电商平台 Bukito 都宣告失败。2023年再次下场创业。 \n任鑫：云九资本合伙人，主要在投资和孵化面向全球市场的 AI 应用。之前是连续创业者，曾经打造“今夜酒店特价”用移动互联网应用特价销售酒店尾房；被京东并购后内部创业“京东到家”开展本地即时零售业务；2015 年再次创业 Get 探索对话式人工智能助理成为先烈；2021 年出售公司，2023 年重新回到 AI 世界。\n\nBGM：\n片头：Shortwire - Reconfig\n片尾：elijah woods - where we're going",

    "url": "http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/06/weekly-issue-351.html",
    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n上海的华东电力设计院新大楼，有一个高达15层的户外螺旋楼梯，象征特斯拉线圈。（via）\nGitHub Issues（几乎）是最好的笔记应用\nIssues 是 GitHub 的 Bug 管理工具，所有代码仓库都默认启用。\n\n它不仅可以管理 Bug，还可以用于其他用途。\n比如，我把它当作投稿论坛，大家在那里提交自己的项目。\n再比如，很多人把它当作内容管理系统，用来写博客，或者存放自己的文章。\n\n上周，著名程序员 Simon Willison（Django 框架的作者）提出，GitHub Issues（几乎）是世界最好的笔记应用。\n\n笔记软件这么多，为什么他独独看上了，根本不是用于写笔记的 GitHub Issues？\n\n他给出了几点理由。 \n（1）免费，可以无限制使用。\n（2）笔记可以公开，也可以私密。\n（3）支持标签，可以给笔记分类，甚至还能分层（下图）。\n\n（4）支持 Markdown 语法，有代码高亮，且可以插入各种图表（比如 Mermaid 图）。\n（5）免费上传图片和视频。\n（6）支持内部链接，可以将 GitHub 网址自动转成标题链接（下图）。\n\n（7）自带评论和搜索。\n（8）除了 Web 版，还提供 Windows、Mac、安卓、iOS 原生客户端。\n（9）提供全面的 API，可以编程创建、编辑、导出笔记，还可以用 GitHub Actions 自动化几乎所有操作（比如发布到网站）。\n它唯一缺少的功能，就是离线支持。如果没有网，就用不了。\n这些理由，说服你了吗？\n我觉得，他说的有道理，确实可以试试，将笔记软件换成 GitHub Issues。\n[活动] 稀土掘金\"夏日寻宝\"\n国内著名的开发者社区\"稀土掘金\"，本月有新活动。\n为了推广 AI 编程，他们与 Trae 合作，推出了主题为探索 Trae 智能编程世界的\"寻宝活动\"。\nTrae 是国内首个 AI IDE，提供一站式的 AI 编程环境，让中文用户轻松上手。\n\n对于新用户，按照要求，完成一些简单任务，参与 Trae 深度体验，就能得到积分；对于老用户，邀请新人注册 Trae，同样也能攒积分。\n积分兑换超丰富的奖品，积分越多，奖品越多，有大疆 Pocket 3、Apple watch、京东卡、机械键盘等等。\n如果你想用好 AI IDE，又想薅点羊毛，那就别错过。\n详情和报名入口，可以点击这个链接，或者扫描上方海报。现在就能报名，截止时间是6月30日。\n科技动态\n1、脑脊接口\n上海中山医院尝试\"脑脊接口\"手术，来治疗瘫痪。\n\n瘫痪的主要原因是，大脑和脊髓之间的连接中断，神经信号无法发给脊髓。\n科研人员在大脑皮层植入电极，收集脑电波信号，然后将信号发送到脊髓神经，相当于在大脑和脊髓之间搭建了人工桥梁。\n今年1月，他们成功实施了这个手术，使一名瘫痪患者在术后24小时内恢复站立和行走能力。\n2、无血型的人造血液\n日本科学家研制出无血型的人造血液。\n血型的根本原因是，血液红细胞的表面有不同抗原。\n\n为了消除血型，科学家从过期的捐献血液中，提取了血红蛋白，然后为这些蛋白做了一个保护壳。\n这个壳不影响血红蛋白输送氧气的功能，但是消除了所有红细胞的表面抗原，因此就可以输送给不同血型的人体。 \n3、网友发现，Windows 11 的开始菜单是一个 React Native 应用。\n\n尴尬的是，它有性能问题。点击开始菜单，很可能会让一个 CPU 核心飙升到30%到70%的使用率。\n4、日本邮政推出数字地址，用户可以领取一个7位数字，代表本人地址，类似国内的邮政信箱。\n\n邮寄时不用填写地址，只需输入这个数字。这样不仅省事，而且搬家也可以保持数字地址不变。\n5、微软的 .NET 代码仓库，允许 GitHub Copilot 自动提交 PR，发生了一件令人啼笑皆非的事情。\n\nAI 自信地提交了有 Bug 的代码，人类程序员向它指出错误，AI 却表示没错。\n人类程序员只能向它解释错在哪里，这个过程持续了好几遍。\n以后，这样的事情会越来越多，人类苦苦向 AI 解释，为什么 AI 是错的。\n文章\n1、我的 Canonical 面试经历（英文）\n\nCanonical 是 Ubuntu 背后的公司，作者记录了他的面试经历，从初试一直到老板的终面。\n整个过程令人瞠目结舌，最重要的问题居然是高中成绩好不好。就凭这种面试，Ubuntu 就不值得看好。\n2、microSD 卡可靠吗？（英文）\n\n作者测试了200多张卡，发现 microSD 保存数据的可靠性很差。数据读写循环3000次后，大部分卡都会遇到故障或读写错误。\n作者评价了10多个常见品牌，可以作为购买参考。\n3、Go 不再修改错误处理的语法（英文）\n\nGo 语言的错误处理，与众不同，报错会单独返回一个值，这导致代码冗余。\n多年来，使用者一直要求有更好的写法，Go 团队想了很多办法，效果都不好。现在，官方终于宣布，不再寻求更好的写法，保持现状。\n4、NLWeb 协议简介（英文）\n\nNLWeb 是微软新提出的一个接口协议，类似于 MCP 协议，是网站跟 AI 大模型的对话协议，方便大模型从网站获取数据。本文是这个协议的简介。\n5、运行本地 AI 的教程（英文）\n\n这篇短文介绍，如何使用 Python 工具 llm，快速在本地计算机上运行 AI 模型。\n工具\n1、Quarkdown\n\n一个使用 Markdown 语法的排版系统。\n2、RsyncUI\n\n一个开源的 Mac 应用，提供 rsync 的图形界面，用于跟远程服务器传输文件。\n3、Donut\n\n一个浏览器的编排器，可以保存各种不同的浏览器配置，根据需要快速启动。\n4、Read Frog（陪读蛙）\n\n一个浏览器插件，可以翻译页面，提取文章主要内容，给出单词和句子和详细解释，代码开源。（@mengxi-ream

投稿）\n4、​​Reddit Top​\n\nReddit 热门帖子聚合网站，可以指定多个频道。（@zhangchenchen 投稿）\n5、美国地址生成器\n\n这个工具网站生成美国虚构的身份数据，包括地址、个人信息、就业状况、信用卡。（@watianle 投稿）\n图片\n1、班克斯的新作品\n班克斯（Banksy）是欧美著名的街头画家，经常会在意想不到的地方，留下作品。\n5月29日，他的最新作品出现在法国马赛市的一面墙上。\n\n他在墙上画了金属安全柱的倒影，那是一座亮灯的灯塔。\n\n下面写着一行字：\"我想成为你所看到的我\"。\n意思是，虽然我只是一根不起眼的柱子，但也想成为你眼中的灯塔。\n\n2、ChatGPT 的散文能力\n一位美国用户让 ChatGPT 用文学语言，描述纽约的生活。\n它这么回答。\n\n纽约是唯一一个让你感觉神奇触手可及的地方。这里的混乱会磨砺你的雄心，每个街角都是一面镜子，让你想入非非，自己会成为谁？\n你热爱纽约，因为它让你的欲望变得具体。在这里陌生与亲密共存；在这里，你可以完全的孤独，却依然跟10亿个脉搏相连。它匹配你的速度。在这里，人们选择优雅地承受痛苦：他们愿意支付高昂的租金，租住在五楼的无电梯公寓，只为了靠近城市的活力，靠近那里的野心、艺术、金钱和疯狂。\n这段话的文学性令人刮目相看，AI 居然能写出这样的散文，堪比散文家。\n文摘\n1、太阳死亡时\n大约45亿年后，太阳将进入其生命的最后阶段。\n太阳内部的氢聚变核心将不断膨胀，最终成为一颗红巨星。膨胀的太阳会吞噬水星和金星，并将地球烧为灰烬。\n在最好的情况下，地球将只剩下一堆冒烟的铁和镍。在最坏的情况下，它将彻底不存在。\n随着太阳的热量急剧释放，太阳系的宜居带（行星表面存在液态水）将稳步向外扩展。\n到了那时，木星的卫星木卫二将吸收大量热量。一方面是因为太阳的辐射，另一方面木星本身也会变得更热，反射更多阳光，从而为木卫二提供热量。\n现在的木卫二是一颗冰冷的星球，被冰盖覆盖。那时，木卫二的冰壳将升华，冰壳下方的海洋将蒸发。\n\n（图片说明：美国宇航局的木卫二探测器飞越木卫二冰壳的想象图。该探测器于2024年10月14日发射，预计将于2030年4月抵达木卫二。）\n木卫二面向木星的一侧，由于吸收的热量最多，升温最厉害。此外，它的赤道带也将遭受严重的水分流失。\n然而，木卫二背对木星一面的南北极，温度并不高，水分流失更温和。研究人员推测，那里或许能形成一层稀薄的水蒸气大气层。\n在遥远的未来，木卫二也许会成为太阳系中任何剩余生命的家园。\n言论\n1、\n有一种新的编码方式，我称之为\"炒作编码\"（hype coding），就是按照媒体炒作的方式，使用 AI 编程。\n一边刷着抖音，一边让一大群 AI 为你编码。如果出错，就让 AI 再试一次，也不阅读它的输出，只把这些输出重新提交给 AI，直到运行成功。如果最后无法运行，那就等待下一个模型发布。\n-- 《炒作编码》\n2、\n在机器大量生产平庸之作的这个时代，自己动手做点什么吧。让它不完美。让它粗糙。就这么去做。\n-- 《这个时代，没人在乎你写了什么》\n3、\n一项研究称，养成一种新的生活习惯，平均需要66天，最长需要8个月。\n-- 《欧洲社会心理学杂志》\n4、\n习惯使用 AI 大模型的下一代人，将不知道图书馆的用途。\n-- Benjamin Breen\n5、\n我们生命中最美好的时刻，并非是那些接受给予、放松享受的时刻，而是那些为了完成一件困难而有价值的事情，自愿将身心发挥到极限的时刻。\n----

    "description": "Databases are a crucial part of modern systems, which means database observability is incredibly important, too. However, gathering information on them can be complex, variable, and tricky to instrument in a consistent way. \nOpenTelemetry is helping to change that, and one of the most important aspects in making it work is a set of shared rules called semantic conventions. These conventions might sound abstract, but they’re actually the backbone of clarity and consistency across observability signals. They tell us how to name things, what kind of data to expect, and how to make sure that the signals make sense together—no matter what language or tool you’re using.\nIn this post, which is based on\nmy recent KubeCon talk, I’ll dive into the role of semantic conventions in improving database observability and highlight the recent work we’ve done to make the OpenTelemetry database semantic conventions stable, which included my own work on creating prototypes and helping with the definitions. This work may not always get the spotlight, but it’s a big deal for anyone building or monitoring systems at scale.\nWhat are OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and why do they matter?\nIn OpenTelemetry, semantic conventions define how we name spans, metrics, and attributes. Think of them as a shared language. Without it, two teams might measure the same thing—like database query duration—but call it completely different names (e.g., statement.duration vs. query.time). That’s confusing for users, hard to work with, and even harder to visualize or aggregate across systems.\nWhen we agree on semantic conventions, we eliminate that confusion. Everyone is on the same page, regardless of language, library, or database. And that’s exactly why we’ve been working so hard to get database semantic conventions to a stable state in OpenTelemetry.\nThe challenge of standardizing database observability\nCreating these conventions isn’t a quick task. We’re trying to define things in a way that works across all databases—from Postgres and MySQL to NoSQL—and in all languages. For example, should we call it table or collection? Should an attribute exist if not all databases support it?\nEven something as simple as rows_returned isn’t so straightforward. Are we returning the number of rows in the buffer, or the total that could be fetched? What if the query is lazy-loaded or paginated? Do we even have events for that?\nIt’s a delicate balance between being specific and being flexible enough to support every backend out there. And yes, sometimes it takes months to iron out all the edge cases.\nBut we’ve made huge progress.\nMaking OpenTelemetry database conventions stable\nWe recently marked database semantic conventions as\nstable. \nThis is huge. It means that the span names, metrics, and attributes you use for database observability are no longer moving targets. It gives developers, vendors, and users confidence to invest in building tooling and instrumentation around them.\nWhat’s included?\nClient spans\nMetrics\nVendor-specific attributes\nThese conventions even include guidance on things like sanitization and query summarization, because privacy matters. By default, no sensitive data is ever sent. You’d have to explicitly opt in if you want to include raw query data—and that feature is still being finalized.\nHow to instrument a simple app with OpenTelemetry and visualize it in Grafana\nTo show what it looks like to use OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions in practice, let’s take a look at an example with React (frontend),\nNode.js (backend, which is the part we will instrument) and a Postgres database. The goal is to automatically generate rich, meaningful telemetry data, without requiring manual instrumentation of every query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This post is focusing on the backend, but the frontend, along with everything else, can be found\nhere.\n\nHere is how to setup the backend:\n1. Set up database calls\nCreate a file called database.js, which will contain the function to connect to the database and all other functions used by the frontend (get, add, and remove user):\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nconst { Pool: PGPool } = require('pg');\nconst { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');\nfunction startPsql() {\nconst pool = new PGPool({\nuser: 'username',\npassword: 'admin',\nhost: 'localhost',\nport: 5432, // default Postgres port\ndatabase: 'db_name',\n});\nreturn pool;\n}\nconst getUsers = async ( pgPool ) => {\nconst queryText = 'SELECT user_id, first_name, last_name, email FROM users';\nreturn pgPool.query(queryText);\n}\nconst addUser = ( pgPool, firstName, lastName, email ) => {\nconst userID = uuidv4();\nconst queryText = 'INSERT INTO users (user_id, first_name, last_name, email) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)';\nreturn pgPool.query(queryText, [userID, firstName, lastName, email]);\n}\nconst removeUser = ( pgPool, userID ) => {\nconst queryText = `DELETE FROM users where user_id=\\'${userID}\\'`;\nreturn pgPool.query(queryText);\n}\nexports.startPsql = startPsql;\nexports.getUsers = getUsers;\nexports.addUser = addUser;\nexports.removeUser = removeUser;\n2. Create routes for the database calls\nOn the index.js file, add the routes to the functions from the database file:\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nconst express = require('express')\nconst db = require('./database')\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = 3030;\nconst pgPool = db.startPsql();\napp.get('/users', async ( req, res ) => {\nres.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\ntry {\nconst dbRes = await db.getUsers(pgPool);\nres.send(dbRes.rows);\n} catch(e) {\nconsole.error(e);\nres.status(500);\nres.send({error: e});\n}\n})\napp.post('/add', ( req, res ) => {\nres.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\nvar users = db.addUser(pgPool, req.query['first_name'], req.query['last_name'], req.query['email']);\nres.send(users);\n})\napp.post('/remove', ( req, res ) => {\nres.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\nvar users = db.removeUser(pgPool, req.query['userID']);\nres.send(users);\n});\napp.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port: http://localhost:${PORT}`));\n3. Install OpenTelemetry dependencies\nInstall the dependencies from the SDK and also the instrumentation-pg one, since we’re using Postgres:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nnpm install @opentelemetry/api \\\n@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node \\\n@opentelemetry/sdk-node \\\n@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics \\\n@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http \\\n@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http \\\n@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg\n4. Configure OpenTelemetry\nIn a new file (e.g., instrumentation.js), configure the OpenTelemetry SDK with the OTLP exporter and automatic instrumentation:\n\nJavaScript\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nconst { NodeSDK } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node');\nconst { PeriodicExportingMetricReader } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics');\nconst { OTLPMetricExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http');\nconst { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http');\nconst { PgInstrumentation } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg');\nconst { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node');\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\ntraceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter(),\nmetricReader: new PeriodicExportingMetricReader({\nexporter: new OTLPMetricExporter(),\n}),\ninstrumentations: [\nnew PgInstrumentation(),\ngetNodeAutoInstrumentations(),\n],\n});\nsdk.start();\n\nNote: In this example, we’re using auto-instrumentation, which already has PgInstrumentation, so is not necessary to initialize it. But I added it to make it clear where the initialization is happening, and also as an example of what you should do when not using auto instrumentation.\n\n5. Add environment variables\nAdd the required environment variables to be able to connect to your Grafana instance:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nexport OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=\"http/protobuf\"\nexport OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/otlp\"\nexport OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=\"Authorization=Basic O...=\"\nexport OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=\"user-crud-backend\"\n6. Restart your application\nBefore starting the app, make sure to initialize it by requiring the instrumentation.js file such as:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nnode --require ./instrumentation.js index.js\n7. Generate data\nOnce the app is running, go back to the UI and do a few refreshes, add new users or remove them to have telemetry data generated.\n8. Visualize the data\nGo to our Grafana instance and see the data.\nTrace and span\nTo see the data, log into Grafana Cloud (If you don’t already have one, you can\nsign up for a forever-free account today) and select\nApplication Observability, then your application using the service name you chose in step 5; it will open the Overview page for your service. You will be able to switch to the Traces tab, where the list of all Traces will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting any of them, you can see the spans that are part of each one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay special attention to the last two spans from the image above. Those are the spans from the interaction with the database: the connection and the SELECT query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also click on the span and it will open its details, including its attributes, such as the following image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\nNow let’s change to the “Explore Metrics” page, and select the metric db_client_operation_duration_seconds, which will display a chart for it. Because the metric has attributes, we can also do a breakdown on them, for example, creating one each for each value of the attribute operation type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenTelemetry and the Postgres instrumentation, we added tracing and metrics with minimal setup. We could then see, directly in Grafana:\nHow long each query took\nWhich operations (select, insert, delete) were slowest\nThe span and metric attributes for each database action\nThis kind of visibility is invaluable for performance tuning, cost analysis, and even evaluating different databases, ORMs, or query changes. Just by comparing durations before and after a schema change, you can validate whether your index actually made a difference.\nAnd the best part? Thanks to semantic conventions, all of this is consistent. So if I switch from Postgres to MySQL, or move from Node to Java, the core structure of my data stays the same.\nWhat’s next for OpenTelemetry and database instrumentation?\nThe stabilization is done for span, the “duration” metric, and their respective attributes, for the databases: MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. That means that other databases and metrics are still tagged under development.\nTo be able to mark the remaining items as stable we need help from the community and database vendors, so proper prototypes can be done for them, following existing semantic conventions to make sure it all works for those or if any adjustments need to be made.\nDuring the stabilization phase, several prototypes were made for different SDKs, now we need to complete the implementation for all remaining SKD languages.\nIf you’re using OpenTelemetry—awesome! Try the database instrumentation and let us know what works and what doesn’t. Edge cases, weird DB quirks, surprising behavior—we want to hear it all. You can reach out using the\nOpenTelemetry Slack channels or creating issues to the\nOpenTelemetry repository that you used the components from.\nAnd if you’re interested in contributing, even better! As a maintainer for contributor experience, I’m always happy to help newcomers get started.\nWe’re building something really powerful, but we can’t do it alone.\nHow Grafana Labs is contributing to OpenTelemetry and database observability\nAt Grafana Labs, we’re deeply invested in making observability more accessible, consistent, and actionable—and OpenTelemetry plays a critical role in that mission. Our engineers are actively involved in the OpenTelemetry community, contributing to the specification and implementation of semantic conventions. This includes helping to define and refine stable, vendor-neutral standards that make it easier for users to instrument, among other things, their database workloads once and visualize the data anywhere.\nWe’re also applying these standards in our own products. For example, Grafana Tempo, our distributed tracing backend, is fully compatible with OpenTelemetry and supports database-related attributes out of the box. The same for Grafana Mimir, which supports metrics.\nBy aligning our observability stack with OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions—and helping shape those conventions—we’re aiming to reduce the complexity of instrumentation and improve the end-to-end experience for developers, SREs, and platform teams alike.\n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case.\n Sign up for free now!",

    "title": "What I Wish I’d Known Before Becoming a Solutions Architect",
    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/culture/what-i-wish-id-known-before-becoming-solutions-architect",
    "description": "My journey to becoming a solutions architect (SA) has been anything but straightforward. After working as an engineer in telecom, receiving my PhD in computer science, and spending time in the energy efficiency and finance industries, I joined MongoDB to work at the intersection of AI and data solutions, guiding enterprises to success with MongoDB’s flexible, scalable database platform. It’s a role that requires having both deep technical knowledge and business acumen, and while the nature of the SA role has evolved over time, one thing has remained constant: the need to understand people, their problems, and how the technology we use can solve them.\nAs I reflect on my career journey, here are some key lessons I’ve learned about being an SA—and things I wish I’d known when I first started.\n \n\n1. Influence comes from understanding\nIn my earlier roles, I thought that presenting clients with a perfect technical solution was the key to success. However, I quickly learned that being a successful solutions architect requires much more than technical excellence. Instead, the solutions that you offer need to be aligned with customers’ business needs. You also need to understand the underlying challenges driving the conversation.\nIn my role, I frequently work with clients facing complex data challenges, whether in real-time analytics, scaling operations, or AI applications. The first step is always understanding their business goals and technical pain points, which is more important than simply proposing the “best” solution. By stepping back and listening, you can not only better design a solution that addresses their needs but also gain their trust. I’ve found that the more I understand the context, the better I can guide clients through the complexities of data architecture—whether they're building on MongoDB Atlas, optimizing for performance, or leveraging our data products to drive innovation.\nWhat I wish I’d known: Influence doesn’t come from showing how much you know—it comes from showing how much you understand. Listening is your most powerful design tool.\n2. Building champions drives success\nYou can build the most scalable, secure, and elegant system in the world — but if it doesn’t align with stakeholder priorities, it will stall. In reality, architecture is rarely a purely technical exercise. Success depends on alignment with a diverse set of stakeholders, each with their own priorities. Whether you're collaborating with engineering teams, product managers, security specialists, or leadership, the key to success is to engage everyone early and often.\nStakeholders are not just passive recipients of your solution; they are active participants who co-own the outcome. In many cases, your design will be shaped by their feedback, and finding a champion within the organization can make all the difference. This champion—whether from the technical side or the business side—will help advocate for your solution internally, align the team, and overcome any resistance.\nThis is particularly important for MongoDB SAs because we’re often addressing diverse needs, from data privacy concerns to performance scalability. Building a strong internal advocate ensures that your design gains the necessary momentum and credibility within the client’s organization.\nWhat I wish I’d known: Success doesn’t come from being right—it comes from being aligned. Influence is earned through empathy, clarity, and trust. As a solutions architect, your greatest value is not just in solving technical problems—it’s in helping diverse teams pull in the same direction. And nothing accelerates that more than having a strong, trusted internal champion on your side.\n3. Winning deals requires teamwork\nAt MongoDB, we’re not just selling a product—we’re selling a solution. Winning deals involves close collaboration with Sales, Engineering, and Client Services. The most successful deals come when the entire team is aligned, from understanding the customer’s unique needs to crafting a solution that fits their long-term goals.\nYou want to win? Here’s what that actually looks like:\nYou prep with sales like it’s a final exam. Know the account history, know the politics, know what was promised six months ago that never landed. Be the person who connects past pain to future value.\nYou do dry runs and anticipate the tough questions. Then you hand those questions to someone else on your team who can knock them out of the park. That’s trust.\nYou turn strategy decks into conversations. A flashy diagram is great, but asking “Does this actually solve the headache you told us about last week?” — that’s where momentum starts.\nYou loop in Professional Services early to pressure-test feasibility. You loop in CSMs to ask, “If we win this, what does success look like a year from now?”\nYou help sales write the follow-up — not just with a thank-you, but with a crisp summary of what we heard, what we proposed, and what comes next. You make the path forward obvious.\nOne of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is that winning a deal doesn’t rely solely on delivering a flawless demo. It’s the little things that matter—anticipating questions, making quick adjustments based on client feedback, and being agile in your communication. Being part of a unified team that works seamlessly together is the key to winning deals and ensuring client success.\nWhat I wish I’d known: Winning a deal is a series of micro-decisions made together, not a solo act. Great architecture doesn’t close a deal—great alignment does. Your best asset isn’t the system you design—it’s the trust you build with your team and the confidence you project to your client that we’ve got this. Together.\n4. You don’t have to know everything\nWhen I first transitioned into this role, I felt the pressure to master every piece of the tech stack—especially at MongoDB, where our solutions touch on everything from cloud data platforms to AI, real-time data processing, and beyond. It was overwhelming to think that I needed to be an expert in all of it.\nBut here’s the truth: As a solutions architect, your real value lies not in knowing every detail, but in understanding how the pieces fit together. You don’t need to be the deepest expert in each technology—what’s important is knowing how MongoDB’s platform integrates with client needs and when to bring in the right specialists. The role is about connecting the dots, asking the right questions, and collaborating across teams. The more you embrace curiosity and rely on your colleagues, the better your solutions will be.\nWhat I wish I’d known: Mastery isn’t about knowing all the answers. It’s about knowing which questions to ask, and who to ask them to. Focus on principles, patterns, and clarity. Let go of the pressure to be the smartest person at the table—you’re there to make the table work better together. Curiosity is your compass, and collaboration is your fuel.\n5. Architecture lives beyond the diagram\nWhen most people think of a solutions architect, they picture designing systems, building technical architectures, and drawing elegant diagrams. While that’s part of the job, the true value lies in how well those designs are communicated, understood, and adopted by the client.\nSpecifically, your architecture needs to work in real-world scenarios. You’re not just drawing idealized diagrams on a whiteboard—you’re helping clients translate those ideas into actionable steps. That means clear communication, whether through shared documentation, interactive walkthroughs, or concise explanations. Understanding your client’s needs and constraints is just as important as the technical design itself. And when it comes to sizing and scaling, MongoDB’s flexibility makes it easy to adapt and grow as the business evolves.\nWhat I wish I knew: Architecture doesn’t end at the diagram—it begins there. The real value is realized in how well the design is communicated, contextualized, sized, and adopted. Use whatever format helps people get it. And before you document the system, understand the system of people and infrastructure you’re building it for.\n6. It’s not just about data\nData may be the foundation of my work as a solutions architect, but the real magic happens when you connect with people. Being a great architect means being a great communicator, listener, and facilitator. You’ll frequently find yourself between business leaders seeking faster insights and developers looking for the right data model. Translating these needs and building consensus is a big part of the role.\nThe solutions we design are only valuable if they meet the diverse needs of the client’s teams. Whether it’s simplifying data operations, optimizing query performance, or enabling AI-driven insights, your ability to connect with stakeholders and address their unique challenges is key. Emotional intelligence, empathy, and collaboration are essential.\nWhat I wish I’d known: Being a great architect means being a great communicator, listener, and facilitator. Emotional intelligence is your secret weapon. The more time you invest in understanding your stakeholders’ pain points, motivations, and language, the more successful your architecture will be—because people will actually use it.\n7. The job is constantly evolving and so are you\nThe field of data architecture is rapidly evolving, and MongoDB is at the forefront of this change. From cloud migrations to AI-driven data products, the technology landscape is always shifting. As a solutions architect, you have to be adaptable and prepared for the next big change.\nAt MongoDB, we work with cutting-edge technologies and constantly adapt to new trends, whether it’s AI, machine learning, or serverless computing. The key is to embrace change and continuously learn. The more you stay curious and open to new ideas, the more you’ll grow in your role and your ability to drive client success. As MongoDB continues to innovate, the learning curve is steep, but that’s what keeps the job exciting.\nWhat I wish I knew: You don’t “arrive” as a solutions architect—you evolve. And that evolution doesn’t stop. But everything you learn builds on itself. No effort is wasted. Every challenge adds depth. Every mistake adds clarity. The technologies may change, but the thinking compounds—and that’s what makes you valuable over the long run.\nIt’s not just a role–it’s a journey\nReflecting on my path to becoming a solutions architect at MongoDB, I realize that the journey is far from linear. From network protocols to financial systems and AI-driven data solutions, each role added a new layer to my experience. Becoming a solutions architect didn’t mean leaving behind my past—it meant integrating it into a broader perspective.\nAt MongoDB, every day brings new challenges and opportunities. Whether you’re designing a solution for a global enterprise or helping a startup scale their data operations, the core of the job remains the same: solving problems, connecting people, and helping others succeed. And as you grow in the role, you’ll find that the most powerful thing you bring to the table isn’t just your expertise—it’s your ability to keep learning, to show up with intention, and to simplify complexity for everyone around you.\nTo anyone stepping into this role at MongoDB: welcome. The journey is just beginning!\nJoin our talent community for the latest MongoDB culture and careers content.",

    "title": "Should I still use analytics?",
    "url": "https://martinfowler.com/articles/202506-whither-analytics.html",
    "description": "I set up Google Analytics on my site in 2010, and since then use it to track page views to my site. I only care about page views, which I find useful to figure out which pages get the most traffic. It’s interesting data, and sometimes rather useful. But Google collects much more information than just page views, and it’s tracking is more intrusive than I would like. But I had other things I’d rather spend to spend my time on, so doing anything about it never made it high enough up my todo list.\nBut last month I finally did something, having come across some information that did I thought did what I wanted. Essentially I want things set up so that I don’t need to bother with a cookie banner because I only track things that are trackable when someone says “deny all”. Based on some google documentation, I changed my google analytics fragment to:\n<script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6D51F4BDVF\"></script>\n<script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('consent', 'default', {\n    'ad_user_data': 'denied',\n    'ad_personalization': 'denied',\n    'ad_storage': 'denied',\n    'analytics_storage': 'denied',\n    'wait_for_update': 500,\n  });\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'G-6D51F4BDVF');\n</script>\n\nAs I understand the documentation, this should turn off the most problematic tracking, but still send a page view event. I took a look at it the following day, and everything seemed to be ok, but now, a couple of weeks later, page views reported by Google Analytics have dropped drastically. Not to zero, but to near zero.\nI’ve spent a bit of time trying to figure out what’s happening. I used google tag assistant and it indicates the page view events are being sent correctly. But that doesn’t explain why I’m not seeing the page views in my Google data.\nI’m not sure what to do next. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, after all I’d rather work on writing and editing. I did consider other services to do the tracking, but it looks we’re talking about $100s a month - and it’s just not worth that much to me. There are open source setups I could try an configure on my server, but again that’s effort I don’t really want to go into. Maybe I just live without analytics data.",

    "url": "https://world.hey.com/dhh/gender-and-sexuality-alliances-in-primary-school-at-cis-97f66c06",
    "description": "The Copenhagen International School is a wonderful private school located in the North Harbor of the city. It's home to over 900 students from around the world. This is where ambassadors, international executives, and other expats send their kids to get a great education in English while stationed in Denmark. As a result, it's perhaps the most diverse, inclusive school in all of Copenhagen. Lovely.\n\nWhat's less lovely is the fact that CIS seems to have caught some of the same gender-ideology obsession that has ravaged many schools in America. We thought Copenhagen would offer a respite from the woke nonsense that's been plaguing California — where some schools in our social circle ended up with a quarter or more of the student body identifying as trans or gender nonconformative — but it seems ideological contagions travel as fast as airplanes these days.\n\nIt started last week, when the primary school, which includes kindergarten, declared its intention to spend every morning meeting for the entire week focused on gender dysphoria, transgenderism, they/them pronoun protocols, and coloring pride flags. That just sounded a bit odd and a bit much at first, but after reviewing the associated material, it actually looked downright devious. Just look at this example:\n\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nDraw yourself in the mirror, then adorn it with trans colors? And the guiding example is a boy who sees himself as a girl?\n\nAs you can imagine, many parents at the school were mortified by the idea of their children participating in this kind of overt indoctrination activities, and some of them let the school know. That's when the revisions started rolling out. \n\nFirst, the program was revised to no longer apply to kindergarten and first grade, just second through fifth. Then the \"draw yourself in the mirror and use trans colors to decorate it\" activity was pulled from the program. Then the schedule was reduced from all week to just a single session this Monday while the rest of the material is being \"reconsidered\". And that's where it stands today.\n\nBut that's not all. After talking to a number of other parents, I learned that CIS has other highly objectionable programs in this sphere. Like \"Gender and Sexuality Alliances\" where primary school students in G3-5, meaning kids as young as eight, are invited to join in lunch and recess meetings to talk more about gender, sexuality, and how to become a good ally to the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \n\nAccording to one parent I spoke to (who's considering pulling their kids out over this), CIS hasn't wanted to disclose all specifics about the staff conducting these lunch and recess meetings with the children. Because while it's billed as \"student led\" on their website, the sessions are actually facilitated by CIS staff on campus. \nI've asked the same question of the school administration, including what qualifications these individuals might have, and have not received an answer either. But ultimately, it shouldn't even matter, because this shouldn't even be happening!\n\nThere's simply no responsible explanation for having kids as young as eight, or even as old as 11, in lunch and recess meetings with CIS staff to discuss gender and sexuality on school campus. It's preposterous, if not outright creepy.\n\nThe school's mission is no cover either. The commitment to an inclusive school does not offer a license to indulge in this kind of overt indoctrination or inappropriate lunch meetings where minors discuss gender and sexuality with school staff. And it has to stop.\n\nCIS, like any other school, should not be a subsidiary of any specific interest organization. We don't want our kids to get their information about climate change from either Extinction Rebellion or fossil-fuel lobbyists. We expect our school to stay politically neutral on the international conflicts, like the one in Gaza. In higher grades where these topics are appropriate, they should be discussed in a context that also includes things like the Cass Review and the recent UK Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIt's the same reason Copenhagen Pride Week saw a massive loss of sponsorship after trying to cajole major companies into a position on Gaza last year. Novo, Maersk, Google, and many others rejected this organization (and they're not returning this year either) for their partisan politics. It's bizarre that those same companies now have the children of their employees programmed by this organization's agenda at school. \n\nCIS needs to return to its high-level mission of focusing on giving kids an excellent education, teaching them objectively about the world, and upholding general standards for kindness and caring. Not coloring partisan flags during school programs, not facilitating inappropriate meeting forums about gender and sexuality between staff and children.\nUpdate: As a result of feedback from parents, the rest of the proposed material intended for Pride Week will not be used at CIS this semester. I'll make sure to follow-up on what might be considered for next semester, as well as the future of the GSA program. Thanks to all the parents who gave their feedback to the school!",

    "description": "The recent disconnection of the ICC's chief prosecutor, at the behest of the American administration, could not have come at a worse time for Microsoft. Just a month prior, the folks from Redmond tried to assure Europe that all was well. That any speculation Europeans could get cut off from critical digital infrastructure was just fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Then everything Europeans worried could happen happened in Hague. Oops!\n\nMicrosoft's assurances met reality and reality won.\n\nThat reality is that all American administrations have the power to disconnect any individual, company, or foreign government from digital infrastructure provided by American Big Tech. So in that sense, it's pointless to blame Microsoft for the sanctioning power vested in the Oval Office. But we certainly can blame them for gaslighting Europe about the risk.\n\nWhat's more important than apportioning blame, though, is getting out of the bind that Europe is in. The continent is hopelessly dependent on American Big Tech for even the most basic of digital infrastructure. If this American administration, or the next, decides to use its sanctioning power again, Europe is in a real pickle. And with the actions taken against the ICC in Haag, Europe would be negligent to ignore the threat.\n\nDenmark even more so. It's no secret that tensions between Denmark and the US are at a historic high. Trump keeps repeating a desire to take over Greenland by fuzzy means possible. The American intelligence services have been directed to increase their spying on Denmark and Greenland. Naturally, the Danes are spooked. They should be!\n\nRegardless of what happens with Greenland, trade negotiations, or geopolitical disagreements, though, it would suit Europe well to become digitally sovereign. That doesn't mean cutting off all American tech, but it does mean rejecting any services that can be turned off from Washington. So in terms of Microsoft, it means no more Microsoft 365, no more Teams, no more Azure.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the two biggest counties in Denmark have announced plans to do. Copenhagen and Aarhus just declared that they're going to get rid of Microsoft products for all their workers. The Copenhagen county is the largest employer in Denmark with over 40,000 employees. So this is a big deal!\n\nThe chairman of the Copenhagen committee who pushed this forward made this comment to Danish media: \n\nIf, theoretically, the relationship to the US gets worse, we could fear that Microsoft would be forced to shut everything down. That possibility exists. And if we suddenly can't access our emails or communicate via our systems, we'll be challenged.\n\nThat's an understatement. Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world. It's also one of the most Microsoft dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there.\n\nBut Denmark is also full of unambitious, defeatist bureaucrats who can't imagine a world without Microsoft. Just today, the IT director for The Capital Region declared it to utopian to think Denmark could ever achieve digital sovereignty or meaningfully replace Microsoft. Not even a decade would make a dent, says the director, while recognizing that if we'd done something 15 years ago, we wouldn't be in this pickle. A remarkable illustration of cognitive dissonance!\n\nSadly, this is not an uncommon conclusion from people who work inside the belly of bureaucracies for too long. Whatever has always done too often seems like the only thing that ever could be done. But, as Mandela said, it always seems impossible until it's done.\n\nSo let's get it done. Digital sovereignty isn't easy, but neither was securing a sovereign energy supply. Nor will it be to rebuild a credible defensive military. Europe needs all of it, yesterday. The bureaucrats who aren't interested in making it happen should find employment elsewhere.",

    "url": "https://grafana.com/blog/2025/06/03/how-to-send-alerts-from-grafana-oss-to-grafana-cloud-irm/",
    "description": "In March, we announced that\nGrafana OnCall (OSS) had entered maintenance mode. However, OnCall’s development continues in Grafana Cloud as\nGrafana Cloud IRM, combining on-call management and incident response into one integrated solution.\nMany users told us they still want to self-host Grafana and rely on\nGrafana Alerting to detect potential issues early—but they also need to escalate and manage incidents using an incident response management (IRM) solution.\nAt first glance, it seems like Grafana Cloud services might only work when you’re running Grafana Cloud instances. But here’s the good news: You can connect your self-hosted Grafana (OSS or Enterprise) to Grafana Cloud IRM.\nWant to try it yourself? The\nforever-free plan in Grafana Cloud includes three active IRM users, so you can try it and get started immediately.\nWhy handle alerts via an IRM solution?\nAlerts are the first line of defense in observability. When something’s about to break, your alerting system should do two things:\nDetect that something’s wrong. \nInform the right people.\nGrafana Alerting gives you plenty of options on the notification side. You can send alerts to Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, PagerDuty, Amazon SNS, Jira, webhooks, Grafana Cloud IRM, and many more. We call these channels\ncontact points.\nBut sending alerts is only half the story.\nYou need more than a Slack ping when a real incident hits, especially outside working hours. You need structure: clear ownership, escalation paths, on-call schedules, and a process to coordinate your response.\nThat’s exactly what a solution like Grafana Cloud IRM is designed to provide, with key capabilities to support and structure your team’s processes:\nOn-call scheduling: Define rotating shifts, handoffs, and time-based escalation logic.\nEscalation chains: Route alerts based on custom internal policies.\nMulti-channel paging: Notify responders via urgent channels like phone call or mobile app. \nIncident tracking: Tie incidents to your existing alerts and your dashboards.\nService ownership model: Tie alerts to services, teams, and owners—not just individual users.\nBuilt-in postmortems: Review timelines, responders, and actions to learn after the incident. \nHow the integration works\nAt a high level, Grafana OSS (or Grafana Enterprise) sends alert notifications to Grafana Cloud IRM via a webhook endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe setup is simple:\nIn your Grafana Cloud IRM instance, set up an Alertmanager integration to receive alerts.\nIn your hosted Grafana Alerting instance, set up a webhook contact point with the IRM integration endpoint.\nThis quick video demonstrates the setup and tests the integration:\n\nThe integration works out of the box. Grafana Cloud IRM understands the default webhook format used by Grafana Alerting. There’s no need for a custom payload, template, or proxy.\nAlerts only flow one way: from your local Grafana into Grafana Cloud IRM, not the other way around. Your dashboards, alert rules, and alert evaluations all remain in your local Grafana instance—you’re just outsourcing incident response to a tool built for it.\nConfigure the alerts that should page your team\nAlerts should indicate a real problem and they should be actionable, but not every alert needs to wake someone up at 3 a.m.\nGrafana Cloud IRM offers a lot of flexibility for handling alerts and incidents with\nescalation chains and\nrouting templates. It also supports two\ntypes of notifications—“Default” and “Important”—allowing each IRM user to configure separate notification preferences.\nSome of your alerts might relate to transient issues or less critical conditions that don’t require an immediate response. Others signal real production issues that need a coordinated response. Grafana Cloud IRM is built for the latter. \nSo before you connect everything to Grafana Cloud IRM, take a moment to decide which alert rules should actually page your team. Keeping low-priority alerts out of your escalation chain helps on-call engineers stay focused.\nOnce you’ve identified which alerts should escalate, there are two ways to forward alerts to Grafana Cloud IRM in Grafana Alerting:\nSelect the IRM webhook contact point directly in the alert rule configuration.  This is the simplest way to wire a specific rule to your IRM integration.\nUse \nnotification policies to route alerts based on labels like severity, service, or team. This option gives you more flexibility and helps scale your alerting setup.\nMonitor your incident pipeline with heartbeats\nWhen you run Grafana, it’s easy to assume everything will just work. But what if it doesn’t?\nHosting Grafana comes with some operational overhead, and part of building a reliable observability stack is planning for downtime and hiccups. If your Grafana instance goes down, alert rules can stop running—and you will miss the chance to respond quickly to critical alerts.  \nHeartbeat monitoring in Grafana Cloud IRM can help with that. You can catch failures in your alerting workflows before your alerts go silent. \nIt works like this: if Grafana Cloud IRM doesn’t receive any alerts within a defined period, it automatically creates an incident. For instance, the heartbeat expects an alert every 10 minutes, and you create a “dummy” alert that fires every five minutes to fulfill that check.\nYou’re not monitoring your services here—you’re monitoring the alert-to-incident pipeline itself.\nHere’s how to set up heartbeat monitoring:\nIn your IRM Alertmanager integration, enable Heartbeat Monitoring.\nSet the expected frequency of incoming alerts (e.g., every five or 10 minutes).\nIn your hosted Grafana instance, create an alert rule that fires continuously at shorter intervals than the heartbeat frequency.\nFor step-by-step instructions and more details, check out the\ndocs. \nWrapping up\nYes, Grafana OSS and Grafana Enterprise work with Grafana Cloud IRM.\nGrafana Alerting and Grafana Cloud IRM are complementary solutions—you don’t need to fully migrate to the Cloud to take advantage of Grafana Cloud IRM’s incident response features. Just wire up a webhook integration, route the right alerts, and let Grafana Cloud IRM handle them through custom escalation chains for a coordinated team response.\nFor full setup details, see the\nConfigure Grafana OSS with Grafana Cloud IRM documentation.\n\nGrafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case.\nSign up for free now!",

    "url": "https://world.hey.com/dhh/omarchy-bottling-that-inspiration-before-it-spoils-cd75e26b",
    "description": "Over the years, I've learned not to question inspiration. To simply let it drive when it shows up with a full tank. Quite often, I don't exactly know where we're going or even why we're going, but it's repeatedly taken me to just the right place at just the right time, so now I just hop in and say: Let's go!\n\nCase in point: Arch + Hyprland. It's been over a year since I created Omakub to smooth out my own exit path from macOS to Linux, and in the process, helped thousands of others enjoy a beautiful, preconfigured, and relatively familiar desktop experience with Ubuntu. And I continue to think this is an excellent choice for Linux, especially for first-time Mac and Windows defectors.\n\nBut this weekend, I just happened to be home alone, and the hype around Arch + Hyprland got the better of me. While Ubuntu is all about being a friendly place for newcomers to Linux, Arch + Hyprland is the exact opposite: It's Linux on hard mode! \n\nAt least that's the reputation, and there's certainly something to that. The Arch ISO literally just dumps you into a terminal with scarcely any direction. Just getting on the Wi-Fi requires learning the arcane command-line options for the iwctl terminal configurator.\n\nBut besides iwctl, it's actually not that bad anymore. We now have a cheat code for installing Arch in the form of archinstall. It's a terminal interface for getting all the bits like picking a disk and creating the first user done in the correct order, without having to set aside an entire evening just to get the OS installed. So it didn't take long to get Arch up and running.\n\nThat doesn't get you much further, though! By default, Arch is about as minimal as it gets. There's no default graphical interface. There are no niceties. Not even wget or curl by default! It really is just a bare-bones installation of Linux.\n\nBut on the other hand, Arch is blessed with the AUR — a Wikipedia-style, community-maintained package management system that seems to have literally every piece of software ever released on Linux, and always in the latest version.\n\nA quarter of Omakub is trying to work around the fact that helpful tools like Alacritty or LazyGit or whatever rarely have official packages for Ubuntu, so you're left doing a lot of manual scripting to get everything a developer would want from a modern Linux setup. Not so with the AUR!\n\nSo that's Arch. But Hyprland is even more hilarious. It's a tiling window manager with something as rare in the Linux world as a keen focus on aesthetics! It looks like it was written by visual artists rather than neckbeards. And it's at the core of the modern r/unixporn Linux ricing subculture.\n\nThat's not the funny part, though. The funny part is how ridiculously atomized the entire thing is. Hyprland comes with absolutely nothing out of the box. No login screen, no menu bar, no notification system, no file manager, no visual settings application. Just a text-based configuration file, a wiki, and an outline on a map for how to design your own adventure.\n\nThis means that if you're interested in running Hyprland, and you intend to set it all up from scratch, you're probably signing up for at least a good 10+ hours — just to install and configure everything! Now, there are some precompiled setup scripts out there already, but most of them still require you to do a ton of manual legwork before you reach that beautiful summit of a complete system.\n\nSo while the downside of Arch + Hyprland is that literally every last detail requires you to make a choice and a config file to move on, it's also its upside: you can change EVERYTHING! And the core window tiling magic of Hyprland is one of the most intoxicating ways of using a computer that I've ever experienced. It looks amazing; it feels amazing (if you prefer using a keyboard instead of a mouse!).\n\nI've poured hours and hours into this quest over the weekend, and yet I'm still not even done with my first Arch + Hyprland build! My login screen looks like shit. I haven't decided on a final menu bar configuration. But what is working — the basic tiling flow and look — is so nice that the inspiration keeps driving the project forward.\n\nWhich, of course, I've already decided to codify. I'm not going through all this work to set up a beautiful, preconfigured, fully-functional, out-of-the-box Arch + Hyprland combo and then not share it with anyone who's curious (and might not have 10–20 hours for this kind of side quest available in their schedule). So of course I registered a domain and found a way to draw some ASCII art: Omarchy is on the way!",

    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n正在举行的第26届舟山国际沙雕节，主题是\"海上音乐城\"。海滩上50多座沙雕，组成了一把吉他。（via）\nJava 三十周年\n上周是 Java 语言诞生三十周年。1995年5月23日，Sun 公司正式发布了这种语言。\n\n三十年了，大家觉得 Java 算不算老语言？\n说实话，我一直以为，Java 跟 C++ 是同一时期的语言。但是实际上，Java 与 Python、JavaScript、PHP 同时期，属于年富力强的年轻语言。\n\n全世界的计算机语言有几千种，Java 是特别、特别成功的那一类。从发布的第一天起，它就很成功，一直保持到今天。\nJava 的成功体现在两方面。\n（1）它无所不在。日常生活中，我们接触到的软件服务，尤其是企业级服务，后端的开发语言大部分都是 Java。\nJava 在服务端是霸主地位，在桌面端也有广泛应用，很多人用它写桌面软件。至于手机端，就更不用说了，安卓系统就基于 Java。\n（2）它的工作岗位最多。\n如果你问我，学习什么编程语言，最容易找工作？\n没有其他前提的情况下，我会建议学习 Java，它的工作岗位最多，最容易找。\nPython 语言虽然也很热门，但是工作岗位往往要求高级程序员，中级和低级的岗位并不多。不像 Java，你只要具有一般水平，就可以去应聘，需要普通 Java 程序员的地方非常多。\n国外有一条经验法则，叫做林迪效应（Lindy effect），说的是一种事物的预期寿命与它已经存在的时间成正比。它已经存在多久，你可以预期，它还会存在这么久。\n那么，Java 已经流行了30年，接下来30年，很可能还会继续流行。\n高斯林口述历史\nJava 语言的发明人是高斯林（James Gosling，1955-）。他在 Sun 公司时，发明了 Java。\n\n2019年，美国的计算机历史博物馆采访他，一连两天，每天三个小时，后来制作了一个节目《高斯林口述历史》（Oral History of James Gosling）。\n网上有视频 + 文字稿（PDF 上，下），他谈了很多东西。下面，我摘录跟 Java 有关的部分，非常有意思。\n问：你什么时候开始研究字节码？\n答：我在卡内基梅隆大学读研究生时，开始从事字节码方面的工作。\n当时，我的导师要求我，将一些软件从一种计算机移植到另一种计算机。我不知道他怎么想的，移植软件非常困难。\n但是我发现，写一个字节码到汇编代码的编译器却很容易，得到的代码质量比原生的 C 编译器还要好，能够顺利运行。\n这件事让我记住了，只要生成软件的字节码，然后为不同平台写一个字节码到汇编语言的编译器，就能让软件在不同架构的计算机上运行。\n问：你怎么在 Sun 公司开始搞 Java？\n答：Sun 公司的产品是服务器，在消费电子领域错过了很多机会。\n我们当时有一群人，核心小组大概只有四个人，想探索消费电子领域。首席执行官同意了，给了我们一笔钱，那时是1991年。\n我们决定做一个原型设备，项目名叫 Star7。这个设备相当古怪，有点像后来的 iPad。事实上，我们团队后来有几个人，确实继续从事 iPad 的研发。\n\n我们并不想做那种特定功能的设备，而是想要一个网络设备，可以跟其他设备相互通信，并进行远程控制。\n我们设想的一个用途是，当时的电视和录像机都有各自的遥控器，我们想用一个设备同时遥控多种其他设备，不仅能够控制电视，还能控制灯光，并且可以互动。\n当然，Star7 没有成功。但是过了30年，人们竟然还在打造这样的设备，感觉有点奇怪。\n问：你怎么想到要为这个设备，发明一种新的编程语言？\n答：我们最初的目标不是发明一种编程语言，但是我们意识到，很多问题都源于编程工具。\n我们想改进一下 C 和 C++，让它们更适合我们的环境。我自愿承担了这项任务，因为我是小组里唯一一个之前开发过编译器的人。\n随着时间的推移，我改动的部分越来越不像 C++ 了，开始像一种独立的语言。\n问：这种语言最初命名为 Oak？\n答：是的，它最初被命名为 Oak（橡树）。这纯粹是偷懒，我当时需要新建一个文件夹，存放代码。我坐在办公桌前，望着窗外，看到一棵橡树，就为文件夹起了这个名字。\n问：一开始，该语言就被设计为独立于特定平台？\n答：是的。平台独立性是我们从一开始就考虑的事情之一。\n这其实来自那些消费电子公司，他们是这种语言的使用者。他们非常不乐意受制于特定供应商，如果某个供应商有问题，他们希望可以更换供应商。CPU 也是如此，他们不希望受制于特定的 CPU。\n问题就来了：如何才能让他们轻松地从一种芯片切换到另一种呢？这不就是我在卡内基梅隆大学移植字节码时遇到的问题吗。\n所以，新语言的核心特性就是字节码，这样才能轻松地针对不同的 CPU 指令集进行开发。\n如果厂商要为某个芯片制造一些东西，比如下一代录像机或电视机，即使处理器架构发生变化，也不用重写大量代码。现有的代码可以有把握地在尚未发明的机器上运行。\n问：Java 的口号\"一次编写，随处运行\"（Write once, run anywhere）是这样来的吗？\n答：我完全不知道这句话是谁想出来的，它是公司的营销用语。这句话说得很棒，但把事情过分简化了。\n问：Java 是什么时候从机顶盒转向互联网？\n答：应该是94年或95年，我们决定放弃机顶盒。因为我们发现，大型媒体公司内心深处，并不想要一款强大的新设备，而是想要控制用户的眼球，多吸引广告商。\n我们决定转向更广阔的领域，让新语言可以用在互联网开发。\n问：Java 是怎么赢得软件开发商的？\n答：我们发现，Java 与平台隔离的特性很有吸引力，它不关心你使用哪种浏览器，因此你可以把平台问题与应用程序的问题隔离开来。\n我们不再以消费者和嵌入式为中心了，而是思考这种语言怎么帮助更广大的软件开发者。\n如果你是一个软件开发者，你不必考虑在谁的平台上开发软件，Sun、微软的 Windows NT 或者惠普。如果你用 Java 开发，你可以把软件卖给使用不同平台的客户。\n问：你们发现 Oak 被另一家公司占用后，才想到了 Java 这个名字？\n答：是的。你要发布一款产品，必须给它起个名字。Oak 已经被其他公司注册成商标了，我们被迫选择一个新名字。\n那时，我们已经准备好发布软件了，就是缺一个名字。我们组织了一场命名会议，询问大家的意见，列出一张大家感觉可以的单词列表，然后发给律师，让他们从上到下检查有没有商标问题，哪个单词第一个通过检查，我们就用那个。\n问：Java 是第四个单词？\n答：是的。我个人最喜欢的是排名第三的 Lyric，但它没通过检查。排名第一的单词，也就是项目组大多数人最喜欢的名字，是 Silk。我不喜欢这个词，觉得它有点吓人，让我想起了蜘蛛。尽管喜欢它的人说，它象征互联网。我忘了排名第二是什么词，但是第四是 Java，我们就用了它。\n科技动态\n（1）内蒙古一煤矿，实现了100台无人卡车的编组运行，操作人员仅仅6人。\n\n注意，无人卡车的驾驶舱位置是电池。\n\n（2）戴森公司创始人，发布世界最薄吸尘器，机身仅高95毫米。\n\n（3）杭州举行人形机器人格斗赛。\n\n比赛机器人采用遥控操作。\n\n（4）丹麦继日本之后，成为全世界第二个国家，将退休年龄提高到70岁。\n（5）阿联酋成为全球首个国家，为全体公民和居民免费提供 ChatGPT Plus，该服务目前的月费为20美元。\n文章\n1、CAPTCHA 没用了（英文）\n\n作者在一家票务网站工作。他提出，各种识别机器人的验证机制，要么可以被 AI 绕过，要么不适用于出票，难以找到有效的解决方案。\n2、我的同步备份方案（英文）\n\n作者的备份方案分成两部分。（1）使用开源软件 Syncthing 在多台电脑之间同步目录，（2）使用 TrueNAS 将本地内容同步到云存储。\n3、Bash 脚本执行心跳测试的写法（英文）\n\n本文教你一种简单的写法，使用 Bash

    "description": "「竞争起来，我才最开心。」\n本期我们同时拍摄了播客视频，将稍晚在 bilibili  B站发布。\n\n今天的嘉宾，是一位去年底被一级市场争抢的明星创业者，乐享科技创始人郭人杰。他 15 岁进入西安交大少年班，专业是能源与动力工程，后在伦敦政经学院获得金融硕士学位。\n\n\n图注：郭人杰和乐享的小型舵机机器人，这是乐享今年将上市的产品之一，目标场景是让极客们做开发。2025 年 1 月，乐享团队将十几台原型机背到美国，用于和美国具身智能公司 K-Scale 联合举办黑客松。\n\n2021 年加入追觅后，郭人杰在不到 4 年的时间里，从营销负责人做到了追觅中国区执行总裁。\n\n去年 11 月，郭人杰离职，到 12 月底，他就拿到了来自 IDG 、经纬、真格、Monolith 和绿洲等机构的天使轮投资。其实那时，他只是想好了一个大的创业方向：要做面向消费市场的智能机器人。\n\n在没有产品和数据的极早期阶段，投资的逻辑是看人。郭人杰有非常强烈的个人特质。\n\n\n他极致接受高频试错和快速迭代，不到 4 年里，他和团队把追觅自有品牌在中国市场的销售额从 1 亿人民币做到了 60 亿。\n\n他像创业那样去上班，倾尽全力、能上能下，4 年里，他两次被降级，又重新得重用。\n\n\n这期节目的前半部分，我们聊了郭人杰在宝洁和追觅的职业生涯——一个“卷王”，能在不到 6 年的职场经历中如何学得更多、成长更快。\n\n后半段，我们聊了郭人杰这次创立乐享的思考，郭人杰的理念是“赚钱养梦想”，他并不会声称，自己要做最前沿的探索，而是希望找到出于 0-1 之间的 “0.5 的机会”，它既不是那种大公司会一齐涌入的强共识，也是一个长周期里都不会有商业结果的方向。\n\n\n图注：乐享科技将推出的机器人之二，用于家庭场景的“瓦力”，计划今年秋天上市。\n\n乐享即将上市的机器人产品也体现了这种思考：比如其中一款，是给家庭市场做的户外陪伴机器人，它还原了 瓦力 的形象，非常可爱，这期封面，就是这款机器人。郭人杰在描述需求时，主要讲了信息交互和陪伴，并没有提到让机器人干活，这确实是目前技术还很难达到的状态。\n\n在攻克具身大脑和寻求底层系统的突破之外，乐享是另一种智能机器人的创业路径。\n\n本期嘉宾：\n郭人杰，乐享科技创始人 & CEO\n\n时间线跳转：\n-去宝洁，为了了解实业\n02:17 少年班经历→伦敦政经金融经济学→2021年加入追觅，参与自有品牌0-60亿增长→2023年11月离职创立乐享科技。\n04:01 加入宝洁时，如何为创业做准备\n10:05 宝洁为何长寿：SOP/数据库/组织架构）、\"敢为天下后\"\n\n-追觅 4 年：从营销负责人到中国区总裁\n16:06 俞浩（追觅创始人）面试时讲：高频试错+快速迭代；敢用年轻人\n21:06 破格用人，\"高激励+高淘汰\"，让大专主播月入 5 万\n23:21 2021 年首战 618 成功，押对了抖音电商红利\n32:08 结果备货没跟上，第一次被降级\n34:47 重被任用后：先做洗地机，再快速做扫地机，功能全包围+差异化（烘干）+便宜15%，以B站长内容引爆扫地机品类\n37:16 开始全渠道布局：不依赖抖音单一红利，拓展天猫/京东/社区团购\n41:39 2022 年中国区销售额达 30 亿，但亏损，再次降级\n51:21 新“军令状”：3 个月扭亏，高价 & 高端化转型\n\n-创立乐享科技\n55:50 离开追觅：生病、管理千人团队超出能力边界、想要新挑战\n01:10:58 乐享科技不追求技术颠覆，寻找\"0到1之间的0.5机会\"\n01:18:08 选择创业方向的 3 个标准：\n            避开纯技术探索和红海市场；\n            全球市场可行性，海外营销+国内研发；\n            与AIGC结合，延长创新周期，避免功能被快速复制\n01:24:00 早期探索：从“机器人玩具”切入 → 发现“可定义动作”是核心价值\n01:42:01 首款产品定位调整，与 K-Scale 合作开发平台机器人（售价$1000）：满足学生/极客的 Sim2Real 需求\n            痛点：高校买不起更贵的机器人，不敢做高风险实验，年轻极客更买不起\n            产品逻辑：舵机方案实现基础运动（行走/跌倒爬起），开放硬件+软件平台供二次开发。\n02:16:01 未来核心愿景“家庭移动终端”：解决拟人化交互（情感连接）+ 全场景移动（室内外地形适应）\n            拟人化：替代冰冷硬件（如用“哪吒声音讲古诗”比平板更有温度）；\n            移动性：突破扫地机地形限制（如履带结构适应台阶/户外）。\n02:18:43 第二款产品：履带式瓦力机器人（预计 2025 年 9-10 月上市）：迪士尼IP授权，一比一电影还原设计\n\n创业策略与行业竞争\n01:53:57 “赚钱养梦想”：短期，教具产品保现金流，长期，家庭终端产品探索。\n02:00:00 拉来科沃斯前 CTO，招募 AI 背景年轻人：创新+经验组合\n02:04:00 与 K-Scale 的分工：互补短板 → “他把我们硬件工程师的照片挂墙上致敬”。\n02:13:40 完全没有竞品的赛道可能没活力：“我创业第一天就渴望竞争”\n02:21:54 多产品并行逻辑：“发挥快速迭代基因，广泛洞察→收敛需求→快速验证”。\n02:25:03 中国硬件公司三代演进：代工仿制→性价比出海→定义新品类和标准\n02:28:43 拓竹启示：3D打印机从极客工具到家庭设备的跨越 ，“重新定义品类是硬件公司的最高追求”。\n\n相关链接：\n《晚点独家丨追觅前中国区执行总裁郭人杰创业做机器人，接近完成首轮融资，估值约 5 亿元》\n晚点聊 112：与千寻科技高阳聊具身：一个像机器人的人，怎么做像人的机器人\n晚点聊 86：We,Robot-2，清华叉院/星海图许华哲看“Optimus”的门道\n晚点聊 65：信仰充值的威力，与逐际谌华聊 GTC 和人形机器人新进展\n晚点聊 40：与梅卡邵天兰聊通用机器人，AI 的下一个浪潮？\n《梅卡曼德邵天兰：“通用机器人” 的吹牛竞赛与现实路径丨具身智能对话#9》\n\n剪辑制作：Nick\n\n本期主播：小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "Here's one of the best tips I know for writers, which was told to me by\n  Bruce Eckel.\nOnce you've got a reasonable draft, read it out loud. By doing this you'll\n  find bits that don't sound right, and need to fix. Interestingly, you don't\n  actually have to vocalize (thus making a noise) but your lips have to\n  move.\n1\n\n\nThis advice is for those who, like me, strive to get a conversational tone\n  to their writings. A lot of people are taught to write in a different way\n  than they speak, but I find prose much more engaging with this conversational\n  tone. I imagine I'm sitting in pub, explaining the concepts to my companions.\n  I've heard people say that when reading my work, they can hear me speaking it\n  - which is exactly the effect I'm after. \nToo often I read prose that feels flabby. Two kinds of flab stand out:\n  corporate prose and academic prose. I often tell people that if they read\n  their prose and it sounds like it could have come from Accenture \n2\n, then they are doing it wrong. And, of course, the passive\n  voice is rarely preferred. Speaking makes this flab noticeable, so we can cut\n  it out.\nIn my case I find I constantly (silently) speak the words as I'm writing.\nNotes\n1: \n      I suspect what matters here is that you need to trigger the part of your\n      brain that processes spoken word as opposed to written word - and that\n      part is sensitive to blandness. \n    \n2: \n      I pick on Accenture since they are a big consulting company, and thus do\n      all the things needed to sound blandly corporate. The worst case I ran\n      into was many years ago when some sparkling prose by a colleague of mine\n      was turned by editors at Microsoft into a tasteless pudding. There is a\n      perceptible corporate way of writing, often learned subconsciously, that is rife\n      and ruinous.",

    "description": "到了五六月份，人就变得特别容易迷茫，我们也收到了很多花卷的来信，诉说自己的恐惧、焦虑和困惑。所以这期节目，Weiya和Guxi决定暂停一下读书的节奏，针对五个极具代表性的问题录一期Q&A，希望能给大家带来一些定力和勇气。\n\n10年前的Weiya重度拖延、颜值焦虑、恋爱脑，一事无成，自媒体账号一年更新100多条视频却无人问津；22岁的Guxi执意从英国搬回北京，经历辞职、分手、没工作没房子住没衣服穿，从零开始一点点搭建自己的生活。我们都曾经历过迷茫，却一路跌跌撞撞、笨拙又无畏地走到了今天。\n\n我们想说，成功的路其实远没有你想象的拥挤，很多事情你不需要拔尖，而只需要做到前20%就足够了，因为随着时间一点一滴的积累，加上撬动杠杆的舞台，足以实现指数级的进步和成长。不因环境反应，只为自己决策，准备会留给有机会的人，勇敢地出发吧！\n\n（本期节目呼应了姥姥最近发的10年视频（xhs @fit4life) ，和今天的fit4life播客内容有部分重复，请注意～）\n\n🌟Highlights（*为引用）\n\n  \n先出发，一切都会准备好的。\n  \n准备会留给有机会的人。\n  \n成功的路其实远没有你想象的拥挤。\n  \n你不需要在某一件事上做到前1%，有的时候你做到前20%就足够了。\n  \n做自己的决策者，而不做环境的反应者。\n  \n用恐惧做指引，用时间做筛选。\n  \n选择的本质是放弃。\n  \n盛世是不均匀的，但英雄在每个时代是均匀分布的。\n  \n不要瞄着过不去的地方，要瞄着过得去的地方。\n  \n走弯路是走路的一部分，花冤枉钱是花钱的一部分，不出战是战斗的一部分。*\n  \n热爱的本质，也许是持续投入后的归属感。*\n  \n我读书的时候实际上不是读，而是把美丽的语句含在嘴里，像嘬糖果似的，像品烈酒似的，一小口一小口地呷着，直到那词句像酒精一样溶解在我的身体里。它不仅渗透了我的大脑和心灵，而且在我的血管中奔腾，冲击到我每根血管的末梢。——赫拉巴尔\n  \n个人的美学经验越丰富，他的趣味会越坚定，他的道德选择会越准确，他就因此愈加自由。——布罗茨基诺\n\n\n00:02:09 Q1: 在人生大事上，总觉得自己不勇敢、没魄力，又什么都想要怎么办？\n\n00:02:53 如果你拥有“旱地拔葱”的勇气和魄力，也许成功的机会就会降临。\n\n00:08:08 从无人问津到指数级增长的自媒体之路，成功的路远没有你想象的拥挤。\n\n00:13:39 叠加身价：与其在一件事上做到前1%，不如在两件事上做到前20%。\n\n00:19:55 找到你的杠杆技能！撬动自己登上发光发热的舞台。\n\n00:26:09 Tips：几个帮助做决策的tips。\n\n00:33:40 Q2&Q3：想跟风，怕掉队？迷茫目标不坚定，环境让人无力该怎么办？\n\n00:36:22 用恐惧做指引：体验过“一无所有”的感觉，也许会更有助于你做选择。\n\n00:43:30 用时间做筛选：十年为什么如此神奇，以至于可以决定一个人的成功与失败？\n\n00:48:07 从古至今，大环境不好是多数。瞄着过得去的地方，也许你就能过去。\n\n00:50:33 没有捷径！你只要往前走，其实路都一样长，并且都通向一个终点。\n\n00:57:31 Q4: 热爱是等来的吗？找不到真正的热爱和擅长怎么办？\n\n00:58:26 Guxi用运动员的心去创业，让热爱不期而至。\n\n01:02:26 Weiya说热爱是一件需要回看的事情，日久生情的热爱更靠谱。\n\n01:05:55 Q5: 读不进去“文史哲”怎么办？\n\n01:10:19 本期学习推荐\n\n感谢  「Strepsils 使立消」 对本期节目的支持！\n\nStrepsils使立消于1958年在英国上市，65年来专注咽喉健康，在英国、澳洲、新马泰等地区都深受欢迎，并且热销全球100多个国家和地区，成为全球性的家庭常备喉糖产品，一年卖出4.2亿盒。\n\n如何选择产品？\n\n  \n橙子味止咳化痰：\n成分盐酸氨溴索是医学指南共识祛痰成分，每粒含15mg，精准起效。\n口服感温润，不辣嘴，含化后还有淡淡回甘\n特别添加天然薄荷醇，清凉舒爽，顺气通鼻\n  \n黑加仑应对喉痛：\n含有活性成分己基间苯二酚，三重功效配方能够抵抗病毒和细菌，缓解疼痛、抗击炎症，有效舒缓喉咙\n5min击退喉痛不适，持续舒缓2小时；快速杀菌，1min开始发挥抗菌活性，5min杀灭>99.9%的细菌\n清甜滋润，含服愉悦不苦涩，无药味\n\n\n\n\n「花卷专属福利」：\n\n橙子味化痰止咳24粒\n\n日常包邮价格：59.9元/盒\n\n花卷专属价：99元/两盒｜179元/四盒\n\n特效黑加仑24粒\n\n日常包邮价格：89.9元/盒\n\n花卷专属价：79元/盒｜150元/两盒｜213元/三盒｜276元/四盒\n\n以下任一渠道均可购买：\n\n  \n淘宝：sourl.co 进入专属链接直接领券购买\n  \n京东：sourl.co 进入专属链接直接领券购买\n  \n复制淘口令：17￥AjkHVjqQuY5￥ m.tb.cn  HU071 自习室专属优惠\n\n\n*链接&淘口令长期有效，记得领券后直接下单哦*\n\n📕本期学习推荐\n\n  \nFluent Forever-Gabriel Wyner\n\n\n\n\n————————\n\n感谢大家对自习室的关注与喜爱！！\n\n我们的slogan是：进步是最性感的事 ~\n\n来信投稿箱：www.wjx.cn\n\n每期对应的学习资料 👇\n\n【视频播客】\n\n小红书、B站、YouTube、微博、抖音\n\n【音频平台】\n\n苹果播客、喜马拉、网易云音乐、Spotify、豆瓣\n\n【合作】\n\n商务联系 studyroom@fit4life.world",

    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/reed-hastings",
    "description": "Today we announced that Reed Hastings, Chairman and co-founder of Netflix who served as its CEO for over 25 years, has been appointed to Anthropic's board of directors by our Long Term Benefit Trust. Hastings brings extensive experience from founding and scaling Netflix into a global entertainment powerhouse, along with his service on the boards of Facebook, Microsoft, and Bloomberg.\n\"The Long Term Benefit Trust appointed Reed because his impressive leadership experience, deep philanthropic work, and commitment to addressing AI's societal challenges make him uniquely qualified to guide Anthropic at this critical juncture in AI development,\" said Buddy Shah, Chair of Anthropic's Long Term Benefit Trust.\nHastings recently made a $50 million gift to Bowdoin College to establish a research initiative on AI and Humanity. The program examines how AI will transform work, relationships, and education, and develops ethical frameworks for its use. These are all areas that align closely with Anthropic's own research priorities.\nBeyond his recent AI-focused giving, Hastings has spent decades working to expand opportunity in education and global development. He has donated hundreds of millions to charter school networks serving low-income U.S. communities and sits on the board of the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP)'s 275-school network. Internationally, he supports East African farmers through Kenya's One Acre Fund and subsidizes internet access in Rwanda, where he helped launch a program offering smartphones for ten times cheaper than they'd cost in the US.\nHastings said: \"Anthropic is very optimistic about the AI benefits for humanity, but is also very aware of the economic, social, and safety challenges. I'm joining Anthropic's board because I believe in their approach to AI development, and to help humanity progress.\"\nHastings has seen first-hand how quickly transformative technologies can reshape society—and what happens when companies aren't prepared for that impact. As someone who's both built Netflix into a global platform and invested heavily in education reform and digital infrastructure in emerging markets, he brings a practical understanding of how to ensure technology serves broader societal goals from the start.\n\"Reed understands that technology companies have a responsibility beyond just building products,\" said Daniela Amodei, President of Anthropic. \"His focus on the human impact of technology—whether at Netflix or through his global health and education initiatives—makes him an ideal addition to our board as we continue building AI that helps rather than harms.\"\nWith Hastings' appointment, the Trust continues to build a board with the diverse expertise needed to guide Anthropic's mission of developing reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.",

    "description": "本期节目由「七度空间蔓越莓红宝石卫生巾」赞助播出，选卫生巾不只是为了“解决问题”，更是对自己最私密的关怀。\n\n今天跟大家聊的话题是经常出现在我留言里的一个词汇——焦虑。焦虑是一个正常的，甚至时时刻刻都会发生的情绪状态，但是我总能在大家的留言中感受到对焦虑的畏惧、无法适应，甚至因此否定自己。所以本期我收集了往期播客节目中有关于焦虑的留言以及一些来自听友群的提问，来分类讨论多种场景下产生焦虑的原因，分析背后的问题该如何解决，希望能够给到更多朋友参考和帮助。\n\n01:18 Q1-40岁了，公司希望自己能转变赛道，但自己不喜欢也不擅长，是否应该突破自己。\n\n02:22 人几乎只被两种能量驱动：爱与恐惧；做与不做的博弈就是看这两者什么占上风。\n\n04:43 世界本身就是变化的，无常才是正常；所以解决问题有很多手段且没有高低之分。\n\n09:07 Q2-在父母公司工作，受到“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”的压力，做不到高能量就很内耗。\n\n12:08 能量本身就是动态流转的，有进有出，有高有低，时时刻刻会变化。\n\n16:14 先爱自己，把自己爱满了、充好电了，才有富裕的能量去爱别人。\n\n20:55 Q3-为尚未发生的事情预设坏结局活得紧绷又疲惫，如何松弛应对生活？\n\n22:22 焦虑的对立面是控制，是不允许事情自然的发生，不允许出意外。\n\n23:45 世界不是单一答案的，意外也可能会带来超越预期的结果与更多可能性。\n\n30:36 生活的强者面对突发状况跟意外的时候，能坦然面对、消解情绪并迅速解决。\n\n39:23 很多事情无法就事论事，多样性拉开视觉维度，不被单一系统的单一观点束缚住。\n\n42:08 Q4-空降领导和自己想法不和，开始怀疑自己思维固化，职场中年人的价值只能由上级的喜恶决定吗？\n\n46:20 出发点不同，表达方式、视角、感受都是不同的。\n\n51:52 当一个人对结果负责任的时候，他就有权决定用谁、怎么用；用哪套方法、怎么用。\n\n53:16 Q5-身材丰满从小被调戏排挤，到现在还在为了低调扮丑\n\n53:53 优势应该露出来让人产生自信心，而越阳光、越正面、越有能量的时候，吸引来的一定是正面能量。\n60:26 Q6-无法建立亲密关系不想结婚，但不想看到母亲因此难过。\n\n61:13 爱不是一种能力，爱是一种本能：想去爱、愿意爱和爱别人每个人天生就有的本能。\n\n67:08 每个人都需要被爱，对象不一定来源于某种具体定义下的关系，所以也不用抗拒爱的可能。\n\n68:08 解决表面的冲突矛盾只能做表面情绪安慰，准确读题解决真问题才会让焦虑消失。\n\nBGM: Can We Work It Out\n\n/关于七度空间/\n\n本节目由七度空间特别赞助播出，明天是5月28日国际月经日，我们和七度空间一起，希望所有女孩都能拥有红宝石般闪闪发光的能量！\n\n即日起至6月20日，登陆天猫搜索“七度空间蔓越莓红宝石卫生巾”，进入官方旗舰店购买享第二件半价，同时发送口令“天真不天真”给天猫官方旗舰店客服，还有专属优惠哦~\n\n点击链接跳转，一起开启自在不设限之旅！\n\n/关于《杨天真的高情商公式》/\n\n高情商=满足自己＋成全别人=成事\n\n我的高情商课程 总结了我过去工作和生活中高情商成事儿的实践经验，28节音频课，从底层认识到行动，教大家成为不仅让自己爽，还能成事儿的人。",

    "description": "🛣️ 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活，我是雨白。\n\n今天这期节目，我们想要聊的是段永平先生，他是步步高电子的创始人，也是非常有名的投资人。起心动念聊段永平有两个契机，一个是他在前段时间宣布退出社交媒体，以后不在社交媒体上活跃了；另外，中信出版社最近整理了段永平之前在投资社区雪球上的问答，集结出版成书。\n\n对我来说，这也是个特别好的机会，能和一位我觉得非常神奇，很早就想介绍给你认识的嘉宾坐下来聊聊天，晓波老师。晓波老师是一位非常资深的自媒体人，他运营的账号大家网上冲浪或许都曾经看过。你可能也在知行小酒馆、无人知晓 和 投资ABC 的评论区见到过他的个人账号，波咕思考笔记。他用同样的 ID 在短视频平台分享了很多自己的学习思考，反响也很好。\n\n这一期节目没有任何的致富密码。我们的讨论全部基于有关段永平的公开出版物和报道，我们试图回到当时的历史环境，还原一个相对真实的段永平，是什么让他和别人如此不同？又是什么能让他创造让今天的我们看来觉得不可思议的成绩？与其说我们这期节目聊的是段永平这个人，不如说我们是想聊一聊从他身上学到了哪些道理，而这些道理又如何影响了我们的日常生活。\n\n我很喜欢这期节目，希望你也会喜欢。\n\n📖\n\n在小红书发帖分享本期节目收听心得并 @知行小酒馆，有机会获得由中信出版社出版的《大道：段永平投资问答录》实体书 1 本。\n注. 活动截止日期： 2025 年 6 月 3 日\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n李晓波：90年二孩奶爸，自媒体「波咕思考笔记」主理人，商业观察者。\n\n🔦 时间轴\n\n04:17 高考总分80分含泪错过浙大，毕业后放弃铁饭碗，读硕后放弃学位，频繁跳槽\n\n10:48 新人上任接手快倒闭的电子厂，靠品控、售后与「空中打法」让小霸王走红全国\n\n16:22 离开小霸王，卸任步步高总裁：那些令人匪夷所思的决定背后的「终局思维」\n\n21:48 「把事做对」：信守承诺、与合作伙伴共赢、宁可亏钱也不愿破坏企业文化\n\n38:51 四十岁赴美后开启投资之路：老巴（巴菲特）说的东西，听起来像音乐一样享受\n\n46:14 段永平创建的企业文化，如何影响了后来的 OPPO、vivo 和小天才？\n\n52:02 何为本分？隔绝压力、诱惑与杂念，回归事物本源，「埋头种因，果是水到渠成的」\n\n60:00 平常心与进取心，在段永平身上并不矛盾\n\n73:02 解决问题的最佳点位，是不要让问题发生（ps.这不是一句废话）\n\n81:05 人生是一场旅程，这场旅程中的体验，就是我们站在生命最后唯一能得到的东西\n\n91:49 「看懂一家公司，不比读一个本科容易」\n\n93:53 一个践行大道的普通人\n\n✏️ 猜你想看\n\n🛣️「大道」\n\n本分。\n\n做对的事，把事做对。\n\n平常心，看长远。\n\n不做空，不借钱、不懂不碰。\n\n享受过程本身。\n\n🔍 相关内容\n\n03:32 晓波老师在抖音解读段永平\n\n24:21 CCTV1 小霸王中英文电脑学习机广告\n\n24:29 施瓦辛格代言步步高DVD\n\n39:52 段永平投资网易\n\n61:34 段永平 2013 年在浙大毕业典礼上的演讲\n\n段永平2025年回校见面会\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🧰 家庭财务工具箱\n\n为未来设定清晰目标，随不同的阶段调整步伐，如实记录当下——这样的规划，或许正是我们掌控生活的开始。\n\n我们 有知有行 App 的有行模块，已经逐步升级成为了你的家庭财务工具箱。这套工具箱可以帮助你更直观地记录和看见自己有多少钱，你的家庭资产是如何分布的，分配得是否合理，以及你是否有把家庭资产暴露在了不必要的风险之中。\n\n如果你是新用户，我们尤其推荐你从家庭资产记账开始，也许你会发现自己比想象中的更有钱。\n\n升级 有知有行 App 到最新版本，就可以体验到了，去试试看，希望你会喜欢。\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 李晓波｜主持 雨白｜后期 柯霖｜制作 雨烨 星星｜单集封面 Recraft\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n北京的护城河公共绿道，位于鼓楼附近。（via visuals_china@instagram）\n神经网络算法的发明者\n上周的《李飞飞自传》读后感，还有后续。\n那篇文章的结尾是，2012年一支加拿大团队使用神经网络算法，夺得了 ImageNet 比赛冠军。\n今天就来说说，这支加拿大团队的故事。\n\n大家看了就知道了，神经网络算法是怎么诞生的，背后的推手又是谁。\n（1）杰弗里·辛顿（Geoffrey Hinton，1947-）\n\n辛顿出生于英国，后移居加拿大。他是神经网络算法的奠基人和主要发明者。\n神经网络的概念，是上世纪40年代后期提出的（提出人不是辛顿）。当时的想法是，既然人类通过神经网络进行思考，那么只要让机器模拟神经网络，机器就能思考了。\n但是，那只是一个概念，并没有具体的算法。机器怎么模拟思考，人们并不知道。\n1984年，辛顿在加州大学担任博士后，与两个同事一起提出了反向传播算法。\n这个算法可以建立多层网络，产生一个输出结果，让神经网络变成了现实，也是后来更高级算法的基础。\n由于它需要多层计算，后一层在前一层的结果上学习，所以被称为\"深度学习\"，辛顿因此成为\"深度学习之父\"。\n辛顿后来因为这个贡献，获得了图灵奖（2018年）和诺贝尔物理学奖（2024年）。\n（2）杨立昆（1960-）\n\n杨·安德烈·勒坎（Yann André Le Cun，中文名杨立昆）是法国人。上个世纪80年代，他是多伦多大学博士后。\n这一时期，辛顿也来到了多伦多大学任教，担任他的指导教师。\n所以，杨立昆是辛顿的大弟子，继承和发展了辛顿的算法。他的主要成就是，为神经网络引入了卷积算法，并且做出了第一个有实际用途的神经网络。\n1990年代，他用神经网络识别银行支票的手写数字，成功获得了企业的采用。\n\n但是，这个应用也暴露了卷积神经网络的弱点：它需要大量样本的训练，耗费巨大的算力。银行支票只需要识别10个阿拉伯数字，如果是更多样化的场景，当时的计算能力难以做到。\n学术界因此认为，卷积神经网络只适用特定的、计算量较小的场景，不具备推广的价值。这导致这种算法，以及辛顿和杨立昆，被冷落了二十年。\n这二十年，杨立昆一直混迹于企业实验室和大学教研室。等到世界重新认识卷积神经网络，他在2018年与辛顿一起获得了图灵奖，现在是 Meta 公司的副总裁和 AI 首席科学家。\n（3）亚历克斯·克里泽夫斯基（Alex Krizhevsky，1986-）\n\n亚历克斯·克里泽夫斯基是乌克兰人，少年时随家人移民到加拿大。2007年，他进入多伦多大学，成为辛顿的博士生。\n这时距离杨立昆提出卷积神经网络，已经过去快20年了。辛顿始终没忘记它，他鼓励亚历克斯和稍后要提到的伊尔亚·苏茨克维，使用这种算法，去挑战李飞飞的 ImageNet。\n亚历克斯就写了一个程序，用 ImageNet 的1500万图片，来训练他的卷积神经网络。但是，计算量太大了，他的个人计算机根本跑不动，他就买了两块 Nvidia 显卡，每天24小时一刻不停地运算。\n事实证明，卷积神经网络+大训练集+高速计算硬件，超过了其他一切已知的算法。最终，他们的三人团队以巨大优势，夺得了2012年第三届 ImageNet 算法比赛冠军。\n这件事轰动了业界，各大互联网公司纷纷邀请辛顿和他的学生加入。百度也伸出橄榄枝，邀请辛顿担任首席科学家，但是最后输给了谷歌。\n2013年，谷歌以4400万美元收购了辛顿成立的空壳公司，将辛顿、亚历克斯、伊尔亚三个人一起招入麾下。\n2017年，亚历克斯辞职，现在一家创业公司研究 AI 技术。\n（4）伊尔亚·苏茨克维（Ilya Sutskever， 1986-）\n\n伊尔亚·苏茨克维出生于前苏联，后去了以色列，然后来到加拿大。他是亚历克斯·克里泽夫斯基在多伦多大学的博士同学，也是辛顿的博士生。\n他与亚历克斯组成团队，共同赢得了2012年的 ImageNet 算法比赛。辛顿作为指导老师，也是团队一员。\n他在2013年跟随辛顿加入谷歌，2015年辞职，成为 OpenAI 的联合创始人和首席科学家，后来是 ChatGPT 的主要作者之一。2024年，他离开 OpenAI，现在创立了自己的 AI 公司。\n（5）安德烈·卡帕斯（Andrej Karpathy，1986-）\n\n安德烈·卡帕斯出生于斯洛伐克，15岁随家人来到加拿大，在多伦多大学读完了本科。\n他跟伊尔亚·苏茨克维很可能大学里就认识。但是，他没在多伦多大学读博士，而是去了斯坦福大学，指导老师就是李飞飞。\n他的方向也是卷积神经网络，博士期间开设了斯坦福大学第一门深度学习课程，担任主讲。\n2015年，他跟随伊尔亚一起加入 OpenAI，成为主要研究人员。\n2017年，他离开 OpenAI，去了特斯拉，担任特斯拉 AI 总监，2022年离职。\n（6) 总结\n上面五人是神经网络算法的主要创立者和推动者。没有他们，就不会有今天的 AI 大模型。\n但是，单单靠他们的算法，AI 不会成功。因为算法需要大量的数据进行训练，而训练需要高速计算的硬件。这三者缺一不可。\n只有等到2012年，才万事俱备。神经网络算法 + 李飞飞的 ImageNet 训练集 + Nvidia 高速显卡，同时出现了。\n历史于是翻开了新的一页，AI 时代正式来临。\n科技动态\n（1）一家深圳公司推出了，可能最炫酷的树莓派机箱。\n\n它自带机箱显示屏、RGB 灯光、风扇、NVMe SSD 扩展板，很适合用作 NAS 和 AI 边缘计算。\n\n（2）芬兰尝试在驯鹿的鹿角，涂上荧光粉。\n\n这是为了方便司机在夜间看到驯鹿，目前每年在芬兰公路上被撞死的驯鹿有4000头。\n（3）在线会议软件 Google Meet，推出实时语音翻译，首先提供西班牙语版本。\n\n在线会议时，对方说西班牙语，你听到的却是英语，而且声音、语调和情感‌都不变。\n（4）意大利开源硬件公司 Arduino，研发出了可降解 PCB（电路板），减轻对环境的污染。\n\n这种可降解电路板，将电路印刷在植物亚麻材料上，而不是传统的玻璃纤维和树脂。\n不过，电路板上的铜无法降解，需要在丢弃电路板之前先回收。\n（5）一家美国创业公司，准备发射卫星，将 AI 机房建在太空。\n\n它依靠24小时的太阳能供电，也不用担心散热。\n该公司希望通过这种方法，解决 AI 服务器的耗电和冷却问题。\n文章\n1、手机的 Linux 桌面环境（英文）\n作者出门不带笔记本，只带手机，再配上蓝牙键盘和 AR 眼镜。\n\n他的安卓手机在获取 root 权限后，通过 chroot 安装了 Linux 发行版，从而可以运行桌面环境。\n\n2、AI 应用的核心逻辑（英文）\n\n作者提出，AI 应用（AI agent）的核心逻辑只需要9行代码。\n3、浏览器默认屏蔽的端口（英文）\n\n你可能不知道，浏览器无法打开下面的网址localhost:6000，原因是6000是浏览器默认屏蔽的端口。\n4、推荐 RustDesk 远程桌面（英文）\n\nMac 电脑访问 Windows 电脑，一种方法就是使用远程桌面，作者推荐远程桌面工具 RustDesk。\n5、HTML <dialog> 的 CSS 技巧（英文）\n\nHTML 有一个原生的弹窗元素<dialog>，本文介绍两个配套使用的 CSS 技巧。\n6、Git 配置详解（英文）\n\n本文详细解释 Git 配置命令 git config 的几个最常见的设置。\n工具\n1、Pyrefly\n\nMeta 公司发布的 Python 代码的类型检查器，参见介绍文章。\n2、Zen Browser\n\n新发布的一个开源浏览器，基于 Firefox，国外评价非常高，使用体验好，参见介绍文章。\n3、xtool\n\nXcode 的替代品，在 Linux/Win/macOS 开发 iOS 应用。\n4、Zero Convert\n\n在线批量转换文件，基于 WebAssembly 技术，完全本地完成，还可以编辑图片。（@xiaoshangmin 投稿）\n5、耗子面板\n\nGo 语言开发的服务器管理面板。（@devhaozi 投稿）\n6、Goravel\n\nGo 语言的 Web 开发框架，与 PHP 的 Laravel 框架保持一致，方便快速上手。（@devhaozi 投稿）\n7、OpenSpeedy\n开源的游戏变速工具，通过调整 Windows 系统时间函数来实现游戏速度变化。（@game1024 投稿）\n8、SimonAKing-Gallery\n\n后端的 JS 相册应用，瀑布流展示图片，指定图片目录，直接运行即可。（@SimonAKing 投稿）\n9、Jwno\n\n网友开源的 Windows 10/11 平铺窗口管理器，键盘驱动。（@agent-kilo 投稿）\n10、星河小程序\n\n滴滴公司开源的跨平台开发框架，支持将小程序打包成为安卓、iOS、鸿蒙和 Web 四个平台的原生 App。（@dos1in 投稿）\nAI 相关\n1、aTrain\n\n一个跨平台、图形界面的自动语音识别工具，基于 Whisper 模型，支持识别50多种语言，参见介绍文章。\n2、AI Image Editor\n\n在线的免费图像处理工具，提供多种 AI 功能，比如图片增强、去除水印、风格转换等十几种。（@worminone 投稿）\n资源\n1、万物博物馆\n一个跨平台的桌面软件，将维基百科变成一个虚拟博物馆。\n\n每件展品与维基百科的一篇文章相对应，墙上的画框就是文章图片，讲解牌就是文章内容。\n\n走廊则根据文章的链接通向其他展厅，有几乎无限的展厅可以参观。\n\n图片\n1、《星球大战》的机器人\n《星球大战》的第一部电影，拍摄于1976年，里面有一个机器人 R2-D2，会四处走动，做各种动作，还会说话。\n\n其实，它根本没那么高科技，拍摄的时候，就是里面藏了一个真人演员。\n\n2、冰为什么体积大？\n水变成冰以后，体积会增大10%，密度因此小于水，使得冰可以浮在水面上。\n那么，冰的体积为什么会增大呢？\n答案是冰的分子结构，跟水的分子结构不一样。\n\n上图左侧是液态水的分子结构，右侧是冰的分子结构。其中，白色节点为氢原子，红色节点为氧原子。\n可以看到，液态水是紧密聚合的网络结构，冰则是中空的网络结构。也就是说，冰的分子结构不是那么密合，所以体积就变大了。\n文摘\n1、Slack 公司的 URL\nSlack 是一家即时通信的软件公司。它的官网有一个\"公司介绍\"的页面，通常来说该页面的 URL 会是slack.com/about，但是 Slack 没有采用这种做法。\n它将这个页面命名为is，并分拆成若干个子页面。\n所以，\"公司介绍\"页面的 URL 是slack.com/is。\n子页面的 URL 如下。\nslack.com/is/team-communication\nslack.com/is/everything-in-one-place\nslack.com/is/wherever-you-are\n这样的好处是单单看 URL，就知道页面想要传递的信息，URL 本身就是对公司的一种宣传。\n这种 is 的巧妙做法，后来被广泛借鉴。碰巧的是，is也正好是一个顶级域名，代表冰岛（iceland）。很多名人就申请了 is 域名，作为个人主页。\n比如，艺术家杰西卡·希斯切（Jessica Hische）的个人网站，域名就是jessicahische.is，她介绍自己的页面 URL 就都是jessicahische.is/xxx的形式。\n言论\n1、\n我们很快会跟大家分享一个低调的研究成果。我们会给它起一个比 chatGPT 更好的名字，以防它流行起来。\n-- Sam Altman，OpenAI 的 CEO\n2、\n加尔定律经常被引用：\"一个有效的复杂系统，总是从一个有效的简单系统进化而来。\"\n但是，它的推论很少被引用：\"一个从零开始设计的复杂系统永远不会有效，你必须从一个可以运行的简单系统开始。\"\n-- Stack Staves\n3、\n宇宙有两种可能：要么我们是孤独的，要么我们并不孤独。这两种可能性都同样令人恐惧。\n-- 阿瑟·克拉克，英国著名科幻小说家\n4、\n太阳绕银河系公转一圈需要2.3亿年，上一圈的时候，地球的主宰还是恐龙。\n-- Reddit 网友\n5、\n我关注了一些教育工作者，他们都报告了同样的现象：他们的学生什么事情都用 ChatGPT，结果什么也没学到。\n最终可能会出现这样一代人，自己的智力很低下，完全依赖于他们不理解的技术，一旦技术崩溃，他们永远无法从头开始重建。\n-- 尼尔·斯蒂芬森（Neal Stephenson），美国科幻小说家，\"元宇宙\"一词的创造者\n往年回顾\n创业虽然好，不敢推荐了（#302）\n互联网创业变难了（#252）\n三个有启发的学习方法（#202）\n从北大到技校（#152）\n（完）\n文档信息\n版权声明：自由转载-非商用-非衍生-保持署名（创意共享3.0许可证）\n发表日期： 2025年5月23日",

    "title": "Activating AI Safety Level 3 Protections",
    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/activating-asl3-protections",
    "description": "We have activated the AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) Deployment and Security Standards described in Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) in conjunction with launching Claude Opus 4. The ASL-3 Security Standard involves increased internal security measures that make it harder to steal model weights, while the corresponding Deployment Standard covers a narrowly targeted set of deployment measures designed to limit the risk of Claude being misused specifically for the development or acquisition of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. These measures should not lead Claude to refuse queries except on a very narrow set of topics.\n\nWe are deploying Claude Opus 4 with our ASL-3 measures as a precautionary and provisional action. To be clear, we have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 has definitively passed the Capabilities Threshold that requires ASL-3 protections. Rather, due to continued improvements in CBRN-related knowledge and capabilities, we have determined that clearly ruling out ASL-3 risks is not possible for Claude Opus 4 in the way it was for every previous model, and more detailed study is required to conclusively assess the model’s level of risk. (We have ruled out that Claude Opus 4 needs the ASL-4 Standard, as required by our RSP, and, similarly, we have ruled out that Claude Sonnet 4 needs the ASL-3 Standard.)\n\nDangerous capability evaluations of AI models are inherently challenging, and as models approach our thresholds of concern, it takes longer to determine their status. Proactively enabling a higher standard of safety and security simplifies model releases while allowing us to learn from experience by iteratively improving our defenses and reducing their impact on users.\nThis post and the accompanying report discuss the new measures and the rationale behind them.\n\nBackground\nIncreasingly capable AI models warrant increasingly strong deployment and security protections. This principle is core to Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP).1\n\nDeployment measures target specific categories of misuse; in particular, our RSP focuses on reducing the risk that models could be misused for attacks with the most dangerous categories of weapons–CBRN.\nSecurity controls aim to prevent the theft of model weights–the essence of the AI’s intelligence and capability.\n\nAnthropic’s RSP includes Capability Thresholds for models: if models reach those thresholds (or if we have not yet determined that they are sufficiently far below them), we are required to implement a higher level of AI Safety Level Standards. Until now, all our models have been deployed under the baseline protections of the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) Standard. ASL-2 deployment measures include training models to refuse dangerous CBRN-related requests. ASL-2 security measures include defenses against opportunistic attempts to steal the weights. The ASL-3 Standard requires a higher level of defense against both deployment and security threats, suitable against sophisticated non-state attackers.\nRationale\nWe have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 capabilities actually require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. So why did we implement those protections now? We anticipated that we might do this when we launched our last model, Claude Sonnet 3.7. In that case, we determined that the model did not require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. But we acknowledged the very real possibility that given the pace of progress, near future models might warrant these enhanced measures.2 And indeed, in the lead up to releasing Claude Opus 4, we proactively decided to launch it under the ASL-3 Standard. This approach allowed us to focus on developing, testing, and refining these protections before we needed them.\nThis approach is also consistent with the RSP, which allows us to err on the side of caution and deploy a model under a higher standard than we are sure is needed. In this case, that meant proactively carrying out the ASL-3 Security and Deployment Standards (and ruling out the need for even more advanced protections). We will continue to evaluate Claude Opus 4’s CBRN capabilities. If we conclude that Claude Opus 4 has not surpassed the relevant Capability Threshold, then we may remove or adjust the ASL-3 protections.\nDeployment Measures\nThe new ASL-3 deployment measures are narrowly focused on preventing the model from assisting with CBRN-weapons related tasks of concern,3 and specifically from assisting with extended, end-to-end CBRN workflows in a way that is additive to what is already possible without large language models. This includes limiting universal jailbreaks—systematic attacks that allow attackers to circumvent our guardrails and consistently extract long chains of workflow-enhancing CBRN-related information. Consistent with our underlying threat models, ASL-3 deployment measures do not aim to address issues unrelated to CBRN, to defend against non-universal jailbreaks, or to prevent the extraction of commonly available single pieces of information, such as the answer to, “What is the chemical formula for sarin?” (although they may incidentally prevent this). Given the evolving threat landscape, we expect that new jailbreaks will be discovered and that we will need to rapidly iterate and improve our systems over time.\nWe have developed a three-part approach: making the system more difficult to jailbreak, detecting jailbreaks when they do occur, and iteratively improving our defenses.\n\nMaking the system more difficult to jailbreak. We have implemented Constitutional Classifiers—a system where real-time classifier guards, trained on synthetic data representing harmful and harmless CBRN-related prompts and completions, monitor model inputs and outputs and intervene to block a narrow class of harmful CBRN information. Our pre-production testing suggests we can substantially reduce jailbreaking success while adding only moderate compute overhead (additional processing costs beyond what is required for model inference) to normal operations.\nDetecting jailbreaks when they occur. We have also instituted a wider monitoring system including a bug bounty program focused on stress-testing our Constitutional Classifiers, offline classification systems, and threat intelligence partnerships to quickly identify and respond to potential universal jailbreaks that would enable CBRN misuse.\nIteratively improving our defenses. We believe we can rapidly remediate jailbreaks using methods including generating synthetic jailbreaks that resemble those we discovered and using those data to train a new classifier.\n\nAll these measures will require ongoing refinement, both to improve their effectiveness and because they may still occasionally affect legitimate queries (that is, they may produce false positives).4 Nevertheless, they represent a substantial advance in defending against catastrophic misuse of AI capabilities.5\nSecurity\nOur targeted security controls are focused on protecting model weights—the critical numerical parameters that, if compromised, could allow users to access our models without deployment protections. Our approach involves more than 100 different security controls that combine preventive controls with detection mechanisms, primarily targeting threats from sophisticated non-state actors6 from initial entry points through lateral movement to final extraction. Many of these controls, such as two-party authorization for model weight access, enhanced change management protocols, and endpoint software controls through binary allowlisting, are examples of following the best practices established by other security-conscious organizations.\n\nOne control in particular, however, is more unique to the goal of protecting model weights: we have implemented preliminary egress bandwidth controls. Egress bandwidth controls restrict the flow of data out of secure computing environments where AI model weights reside. The combined weights of a model are substantial in size. By limiting the rate of outbound network traffic, these controls can leverage model weight size to create a security advantage. When potential exfiltration of model weights is detected through unusual bandwidth usage, security systems can block the suspicious traffic. Over time, we expect to get to the point where rate limits are low enough that exfiltrating model weights before being detected is very difficult—even if an attacker has otherwise significantly compromised our systems. Implementing egress bandwidth controls has been a forcing function to understand and govern the way in which data is flowing outside of our internal systems, which has yielded benefits for our detection and response capabilities.\n\nAs with the deployment protections, we are continuing to work on improving the coverage and maturity of our security controls, always taking into account the evolving threat landscape. In particular, we will continue improving our egress controls, mitigations against more sophisticated insider threats, and our overall security posture.\nConclusions\nAs we have emphasized above, the question of which deployment and security measures to apply to frontier AI models is far from solved. We will continue to introspect, iterate, and improve. The practical experience of operating under the ASL-3 Standards will help us uncover new and perhaps unexpected issues and opportunities.\nWe will continually work with others in the AI industry, users of Claude, and partners in government and civil society to improve our methods of guarding these models. We hope that our detailed report will be of use to others in the AI industry attempting to implement similar protections and help us all prepare for the promise and challenge of even more capable AI.\nRead the full report.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1The RSP is only one component of our approach to mitigating potential risks.\n2In particular, we had some evidence of improved CBRN-related capabilities. Experiments showed that access to Claude Sonnet 3.7 helped participants do somewhat better on tasks related to CBRN weapon acquisition than those with standard internet access (although all participants’ plans still had critical failures). Model performance on evaluations like the Virology Capabilities Test had been steadily increasing over time.\n3Initially they are focused exclusively on biological weapons as we believe these account for the vast majority of the risk, although we are evaluating a potential expansion in scope to some other CBRN threats.\n4 We have also established access control systems so that users with dual-use science and technology applications may be vetted to receive targeted exemptions from some classifier actions.\n5For more information on our assessment of the effectiveness and sufficiency of these measures, see the ASL-3 Deployment Safeguards Report.\n6Nation-state threats (other than those using non-novel attack chains) and sophisticated insider risk are out of the scope of the ASL-3 Standard.",

    "title": "Introducing Claude 4",
    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4",
    "description": "Today, we’re introducing the next generation of Claude models: Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, setting new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents. \nClaude Opus 4 is the world’s best coding model, with sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows. Claude Sonnet 4 is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7, delivering superior coding and reasoning while responding more precisely to your instructions.\n\n\n\nAlongside the models, we're also announcing:\n\nExtended thinking with tool use (beta): Both models can use tools—like web search—during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve responses.\nNew model capabilities: Both models can use tools in parallel, follow instructions more precisely, and—when given access to local files by developers—demonstrate significantly improved memory capabilities, extracting and saving key facts to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time.\nClaude Code is now generally available: After receiving extensive positive feedback during our research preview, we’re expanding how developers can collaborate with Claude. Claude Code now supports background tasks via GitHub Actions and native integrations with VS Code and JetBrains, displaying edits directly in your files for seamless pair programming.\nNew API capabilities: We’re releasing four new capabilities on the Anthropic API that enable developers to build more powerful AI agents: the code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API, and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour.\n\nClaude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid models offering two modes: near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning. The Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise Claude plans include both models and extended thinking, with Sonnet 4 also available to free users. Both models are available on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Pricing remains consistent with previous Opus and Sonnet models: Opus 4 at $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) and Sonnet 4 at $3/$15.\nClaude 4\nClaude Opus 4 is our most powerful model yet and the best coding model in the world, leading on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%). It delivers sustained performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps, with the ability to work continuously for several hours—dramatically outperforming all Sonnet models and significantly expanding what AI agents can accomplish.\nClaude Opus 4 excels at coding and complex problem-solving, powering frontier agent products. Cursor calls it state-of-the-art for coding and a leap forward in complex codebase understanding. Replit reports improved precision and dramatic advancements for complex changes across multiple files. Block calls it the first model to boost code quality during editing and debugging in its agent, codename goose, while maintaining full performance and reliability. Rakuten validated its capabilities with a demanding open-source refactor running independently for 7 hours with sustained performance. Cognition notes Opus 4 excels at solving complex challenges that other models can't, successfully handling critical actions that previous models have missed.\nClaude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7's industry-leading capabilities, excelling in coding with a state-of-the-art 72.7% on SWE-bench. The model balances performance and efficiency for internal and external use cases, with enhanced steerability for greater control over implementations. While not matching Opus 4 in most domains, it delivers an optimal mix of capability and practicality.\nGitHub says Claude Sonnet 4 soars in agentic scenarios and will introduce it as the model powering the new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. Manus highlights its improvements in following complex instructions, clear reasoning, and aesthetic outputs. iGent reports Sonnet 4 excels at autonomous multi-feature app development, as well as substantially improved problem-solving and codebase navigation—reducing navigation errors from 20% to near zero. Sourcegraph says the model shows promise as a substantial leap in software development—staying on track longer, understanding problems more deeply, and providing more elegant code quality. Augment Code reports higher success rates, more surgical code edits, and more careful work through complex tasks, making it the top choice for their primary model.\nThese models advance our customers' AI strategies across the board: Opus 4 pushes boundaries in coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery, while Sonnet 4 brings frontier performance to everyday use cases as an instant upgrade from Sonnet 3.7.\nClaude 4 models lead on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for performance on real software engineering tasks. See appendix for more on methodology.\n\n \nModel improvements\nIn addition to extended thinking with tool use, parallel tool execution, and memory improvements, we’ve significantly reduced behavior where the models use shortcuts or loopholes to complete tasks. Both models are 65% less likely to engage in this behavior than Sonnet 3.7 on agentic tasks that are particularly susceptible to shortcuts and loopholes.\nClaude Opus 4 also dramatically outperforms all previous models on memory capabilities. When developers build applications that provide Claude local file access, Opus 4 becomes skilled at creating and maintaining 'memory files' to store key information. This unlocks better long-term task awareness, coherence, and performance on agent tasks—like Opus 4 creating a 'Navigation Guide' while playing Pokémon.\nMemory: When given access to local files, Claude Opus 4 records key information to help improve its game play. The notes depicted above are real notes taken by Opus 4 while playing Pokémon.\nFinally, we've introduced thinking summaries for Claude 4 models that use a smaller model to condense lengthy thought processes. This summarization is only needed about 5% of the time—most thought processes are short enough to display in full. Users requiring raw chains of thought for advanced prompt engineering can contact sales about our new Developer Mode to retain full access.\nClaude Code\nClaude Code, now generally available, brings the power of Claude to more of your development workflow—in the terminal, your favorite IDEs, and running in the background with the Claude Code SDK.\nNew beta extensions for VS Code and JetBrains integrate Claude Code directly into your IDE. Claude’s proposed edits appear inline in your files, streamlining review and tracking within the familiar editor interface. Simply run Claude Code in your IDE terminal to install.\nBeyond the IDE, we're releasing an extensible Claude Code SDK, so you can build your own agents and applications using the same core agent as Claude Code. We're also releasing an example of what's possible with the SDK: Claude Code on GitHub, now in beta. Tag Claude Code on PRs to respond to reviewer feedback, fix CI errors, or modify code. To install, run /install-github-app from within Claude Code.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\nThese models are a large step toward the virtual collaborator—maintaining full context, sustaining focus on longer projects, and driving transformational impact. They come with extensive testing and evaluation to minimize risk and maximize safety, including implementing measures for higher AI Safety Levels like ASL-3.\nWe're excited to see what you'll create. Get started today on Claude, Claude Code, or the platform of your choice.\nAs always, your feedback helps us improve.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nPerformance benchmark data sources\n\nOpen AI: o3 launch post, o3 system card, GPT-4.1 launch post, GPT-4.1 hosted evals\nGemini: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview model card\nClaude: Claude 3.7 Sonnet launch post\n\nPerformance benchmark reporting\nClaude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid reasoning models. The benchmarks reported in this blog post show the highest scores achieved with or without extended thinking. We’ve noted below for each result whether extended thinking was used:\n\n\nNo extended thinking: SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-bench\nExtended thinking (up to 64K tokens):\nTAU-bench (no results w/o extended thinking reported)\nGPQA Diamond (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 74.9% and Sonnet 4 is 70.0%)\nMMMLU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 87.4% and Sonnet 4 is 85.4%)\nMMMU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 73.7% and Sonnet 4 is 72.6%)\nAIME (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 33.9% and Sonnet 4 is 33.1%)\n\n\nTAU-bench methodology\nScores were achieved with a prompt addendum to both the Airline and Retail Agent Policy instructing Claude to better leverage its reasoning abilities while using extended thinking with tool use. The model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities. To accommodate the additional steps Claude incurs by utilizing more thinking, the maximum number of steps (counted by model completions) was increased from 30 to 100 (most trajectories completed under 30 steps with only one trajectory reaching above 50 steps).\nSWE-bench methodology\nFor the Claude 4 family of models, we continue to use the same simple scaffold that equips the model with solely the two tools described in our prior releases here—a bash tool, and a file editing tool that operates via string replacements. We no longer include the third ‘planning tool’ used by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On all Claude 4 models, we report scores out of the full 500 problems. Scores for OpenAI models are reported out of a 477 problem subset.\n\nFor our “high compute” numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:\n\nWe sample multiple parallel attempts.\nWe discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by Agentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used.\nWe then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.\n\nThis results in a score of 79.4% and 80.2% for Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 respectively.",

    "title": "New capabilities for building agents on the Anthropic API",
    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/agent-capabilities-api",
    "description": "Today, we're announcing four new capabilities on the Anthropic API that enable developers to build more powerful AI agents: the code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API, and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour.\nBuilding better AI agents\nTogether with Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, these beta features enable developers to build agents that execute code for advanced data analysis, connect to external systems through MCP servers, store and access files efficiently across sessions, and maintain context for up to 60 minutes with cost-effective caching—without building custom infrastructure.\nFor example, a project management AI agent can use the MCP connector with Asana to reference tasks and assign work, upload relevant reports via the Files API, analyze progress and risks with the code execution tool, and maintain full context throughout—all while keeping costs down through extended prompt caching.\nThese capabilities join existing features like web search and citations as part of a comprehensive toolkit for building AI agents. Read on to explore each new capability in detail.\nCode execution tool\nWe're introducing a code execution tool on the Anthropic API, giving Claude the ability to run Python code in a sandboxed environment to produce computational results and data visualizations. This transforms Claude from a code-writing assistant into a data analyst that can iterate on visualizations, clean datasets, and derive insights directly within API calls.\n\n\n\nWith the code execution tool, Claude can load datasets, generate exploratory charts, identify patterns, and iteratively refine outputs based on execution results—all within a single interaction. This means that Claude can handle complex analytical tasks end-to-end, rather than just suggesting code for you to run separately.\nKey use cases include:\n\nFinancial modeling: Generate financial projections, analyze investment portfolios, and calculate complex financial metrics.\nScientific computing: Execute simulations, process experimental data, and analyze research datasets.\nBusiness intelligence: Create automated reports, analyze sales data, and generate performance dashboards.\nDocument processing: Extract and transform data across formats, generate formatted reports, and automate document workflows.\nStatistical analysis: Perform regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling on datasets.\n\nOrganizations receive 50 free hours of usage with the code execution tool per day, then pay $0.05 per hour per container for additional usage. Explore the documentation to learn more about pricing.\nMCP connector\nThe MCP connector on the Anthropic API enables developers to connect Claude to any remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server without writing client code.\nPreviously, connecting to MCP servers required building your own client harness to handle MCP connections. Now, the Anthropic API handles all connection management, tool discovery, and error handling automatically. Simply add a remote MCP server URL to your API request and you can immediately access powerful third-party tools, dramatically reducing the complexity of building tool-enabled agents.\nWhen Claude receives a request with MCP servers configured, it automatically: \n\nConnects to the specified MCP servers\nRetrieves available tools\nReasons about what tool to call and what arguments to pass\nExecutes tool calls agentically until a sufficient result is achieved\nManages authentication and error handling\nReturns the enhanced response with integrated data\n\nThe growing ecosystem of remote MCP servers means you can easily add capabilities to your AI applications without building one-off integrations. You can integrate with any remote MCP server, including those from Zapier and Asana. See more remote MCP servers in our documentation.\nFiles API\nThe Files API simplifies how developers store and access documents when building with Claude. Instead of managing file uploads in every request, you can now upload documents once and reference them repeatedly across conversations.\nThis streamlines development workflows, particularly for applications that need to work with large document sets such as knowledge bases, technical documentation, or datasets.\nThe Files API will integrate with the code execution tool, enabling Claude to access and process uploaded files directly during code execution and produce files such as charts and graphs as part of the response. This means developers can upload a dataset through the Files API once, then have Claude analyze it across multiple sessions without re-uploading.\nExtended prompt caching\nDevelopers can now choose between our standard 5-minute time to live (TTL) for prompt caching or opt for an extended 1-hour TTL at an additional cost—a 12x improvement that can reduce expenses for long-running agent workflows. With extended caching, customers can provide Claude with extensive background knowledge and examples while reducing costs by up to 90% and latency by up to 85% for long prompts.\nThis makes it practical to build agents that maintain context over extended periods, whether they're handling multi-step workflows, analyzing complex documents, or coordinating with other systems. Long-running agent applications that previously faced prohibitive costs can now operate efficiently at scale.\nGetting started\nAll of these features are now available in public beta on the Anthropic API. Visit our documentation to learn more or watch the keynote from our developer conference to see these capabilities in action.",

    "description": "作为 AI 技术发展 「数据、算法、算力」 三大要素之一，数据已经成为推动 AI 发展的关键。根据统计，2025 年全球数据总量将突破 175 ZB，数据的形式和内容也发生了巨变，图片、音频、视频等无结构、多模态、碎片化的数据规模激增，传统数据库系统正面临前所未有的挑战。AI 时代的数据基础设施，究竟应该如何重构？\n\n在人工智能时代，数据如何从 「支撑系统」走向 「智能引擎」？为何数据公司的本质是一家 AI 公司？作为国内的数据库的领跑者，OceanBase 如何以原生分布式 + 一体化架构应对这一范式跃迁？国产数据库出海的关键突破口是什么？\n本期节目，我们邀请到国内领先的数据库企业 OceanBase CTO 杨传辉与我们深入的聊一聊 AI 时代，我们正在经历的数据革命以及机会窗口。\n\nOceanBase 官网\n\n本期人物\n杨传辉，OceanBase CTO \n丁教 Diane，「声动活泼」联合创始人、「科技早知道」主播\n\n主要话题\n01:54 数据三重挑战：类型爆发、体量翻倍、混合查询\n03:53 AI 时代数据赛道的确定性：PaaS 层是企业刚需\n05:18  从「数据债」到 「数据资产」：企业如何补课？\n12:28 AI for Data vs. Data for AI: 双向驱动已成主流范式\n15:51 AI 重构传统 IT 分工，中间件、SaaS 会消失吗？\n22:00 数据公司 x AI 公司：为何终将殊途同归？\n25:47 OceanBase 的技术坚持：「复杂留给我们，简单留给客户」\n28:42 数据基础设施出海：中国公司如何建立全球生态？\n32:21 从交易、分析到 AI 混合处理：一体化架构的演进逻辑\n41:46 向千万家企业普及 AI 数据底座：开源战略背后的全球愿景\n\n幕后制作\n监制：Yaxian\n后期：Jack、迪卡\n运营：George \n设计：饭团\n\n延伸阅读\nOceanBase\nOceanBase是由蚂蚁集团100%自主研发的国产原生分布式数据库，始创于2010年。已连续15年平稳支撑双11，创新推出“三地五中心”城市级容灾新标准，是一个在TPC-C和TPC-H测试上都刷新了世界纪录的国产原生分布式数据库。\n产品采用自主研发的一体化架构，兼顾分布式架构的扩展性与集中式架构的性能优势，用一套引擎同时支持TP、AP和AI的混合负载，原生支持向量检索与多模数据混合检索，助力客户构建面向 AI 的一体化数据底座。目前OceanBase已助力金融、政府、运营商、零售、互联网等2000家企业实现关键业务系统升级。\n产品官网\n\nMySQL\n是一款开源的关系型数据库管理系统（RDBMS），基于 SQL（Structured Query Language，结构化查询语言） 实现数据存储、查询和管理。它以轻量、高效、易部署的特点广泛应用于 Web 开发、中小企业系统等场景，支持高并发读写，且社区生态成熟，是全球最流行的开源数据库之一。\n\nRAG\n即 Retrieval-Augmented Generation（检索增强生成），是一种融合大语言模型（LLM）与外部知识库检索的技术框架。其核心逻辑是：在模型生成内容前，先通过检索工具从结构化或非结构化数据中获取相关信息，再结合检索结果生成回答。这一技术可有效减少模型 “幻觉” 问题，提升回答的准确性和时效性，常用于企业知识库问答、实时数据驱动的内容生成等场景。\n\nSaaS\n即 Software-as-a-Service（软件即服务）, 是一种云计算服务模式，通过互联网向用户提供现成的软件应用。用户无需购买软件授权或本地部署服务器，只需按需订阅并通过浏览器或客户端访问服务。SaaS 模式降低了企业的 IT 成本，简化了软件维护流程，尤其适合中小企业快速实现数字化转型。\n\nPaaS\n即 Platform-as-a-Service（平台即服务），是云计算层级中的中间层服务，为开发者提供完整的应用开发、测试和部署平台。它包括数据库、中间件、开发工具、容器服务等组件（如阿里云的 PAAS 层提供 OceanBase 数据库、函数计算等）。开发者可基于 PaaS 平台快速构建应用，无需关注底层基础设施，从而聚焦业务逻辑创新。\n\nIaaS\n即 Infrastructure-as-a-Service（基础设施即服务），是云计算的基础层服务，通过虚拟化技术向用户提供计算、存储、网络等底层 IT 基础设施（如 AWS EC2 服务器、阿里云 ECS 实例）。用户可根据需求灵活配置资源，自主安装操作系统和软件，拥有较高的控制权和自定义空间。IaaS 是 PaaS 和 SaaS 的基础，适用于需要自主管理基础设施的企业和开发者。\n\n内容研究志愿者招募\nHi 你好呀，这里是「科技早知道」内容研究志愿者招募。如果你是前沿科技行业的从业者（包括但不限于半导体、先进制造、计算机、AI、生物医药、航空航天等等），欢迎加入我们分享你在行业内的一手观察和见解。\n你将有机会参与到节目的制作当中，你的知识和见解也可能成为未来节目的一部分！\n志愿者招募入口\n\n加入声动活泼\n声动活泼目前开放全职设计师、商业发展经理、商业内容策划、内容编辑实习生、早咖啡内容研究实习生、社群运营实习生等6个职位，详情点击招聘入口\n\n商务合作\n声动活泼商务合作咨询\n\n\n关于声动活泼\n「用声音碰撞世界」，声动活泼致力于为人们提供源源不断的思考养料。\n我们还有这些播客：声动早咖啡、声东击西、吃喝玩乐了不起、反潮流俱乐部、泡腾 VC、商业WHY酱、跳进兔子洞 、不止金钱\n欢迎在即刻、微博等社交媒体上与我们互动，搜索 声动活泼 即可找到我们。\n期待你给我们写邮件，邮箱地址是：ting@sheng.fm\n\n欢迎扫码添加声小音，在节目之外和我们保持联系。\nSpecial Guest: 杨传辉.",

    "description": "Google I/O大会上推出了一款名为Stitch的AI工具，旨在助力开发者将初步UI概念迅速转变为功能完善的移动和网页前端界面。\n\n链接（外网）：https://stitch.withgoogle.com/\n\n核心特性\n智能UI生成：借助Google的Gemini 2.5系列模型，通过简短文本或图片输入，就可以快速产出精美UI设计及HTML/CSS代码，刚试过了，几分钟就可以。可直接指定色彩方案或交互细节，生成适配多设备的界面。\n\n多样化设计选项：提供多种界面风格与布局选择，方便使用者探索不同设计方向。生成的界面可直接用于开发，也可以导入Figma进行精细调整与团队协作。\n\n高效协作流程：通过AI对话、主题定制等功能优化设计到开发的衔接，有消息称未来还将支持基于截图的UI修改。Stitch 更专注于快速原型迭代，而非替代专业设计工具如Figma。\n\n实验阶段：作为Google Labs的Beta项目，Stitch目前免费，目前仅限英文输入，部分功能如跨浏览器兼容性尚待完善，计划未来支持多语言及更复杂功能。\n\n使用场景\n适合快速原型开发，例如为音乐爱好者打造的移动端界面或实验记录网页仪表盘之类的，适用于需快速验证创意的开发者和设计师。\n\n目前局限性\n暂不支持代码手动修改，功能较为初级，不适合复杂设计需求。用户反馈称其生成速度和Figma集成表现优秀，不过设计质量还差点。",

    "description": "Our battle with Apple over their gangster attempt to extort 30% of our HEY revenues was one of the defining moments of my career. It was the kind of test that calls you to account for what you believe and asks what you're willing to risk to see it through. Well, we risked everything, but also secured a four-year truce, and now near-total victory is at hand: HEY is finally for sale on the iPhone in the US!\n\nCredit for this amazing turn of events goes to Epic Games founders Tim Sweeney and Mark Rein, who did what no small developer like us could ever dream of doing: they spent over $100 million to sue Apple in court. And while the first round yielded very little progress, Apple's (possibly criminal) contempt of court is what ultimately delivered the resolution. Thanks to their fight for Fortnite, app developers everywhere are now allowed to link out of apps to their own web-based payment system in the US store (but, sadly, nowhere else yet).\n\nThis is all we ever wanted from Apple: to have a way to distribute our iPhone apps and keep the customer relationship by billing directly. The 30% toll gets all the attention, and it is ludicrously egregious, but to us, it's just as much about retaining that direct customer relationship, so we can help folks with refunds, so they don't tie their billing for a multi-platform email system to a single manufacturer.\n\nApple always claims to put the needs of the users first, and that whatever hardship developers have to carry is justified by their customer-focused obsession. But in this case, it's clear that the obsession was with collecting the easiest billions Apple has ever made, by taking an obscene cut of all software and subscription sales on the platform.\n\nThis obsession with squeezing every last dollar from developers has produced countless customer-hostile experiences on the iPhone. Like how you couldn't buy a book in the Kindle app before this (now you can!). Or sign up for a Netflix subscription (now you can!). Before, users would hunt in vain for an explanation inside these apps, and thanks to Apple's gag orders, developers were not even allowed to explain the confusing situation.\n\nIt's been the same deal with HEY. While we successfully fought off Apple's attempt to extort us into using their in-app payment system (IAP), we've been stuck with an awkward user experience ever since. One that prevented new customers from signing up for a real email address in the application, and instead sent them down this bizarre burner-account setup. All so the app would \"do something\", in order to please an argument that App Store chief Phil Schiller made up on the fly in an interview.\n\nThat's what we can now get rid of. No more weird burner accounts. Now you can sign up directly for a real email address in HEY, and if you like what we have to offer (and I think you will!), you'll be able to pay the $99/year for a subscription via a web-based flow that it's now kosher to link to from the app itself.\n\nWhat a journey, and what a needless torching of the developer relationship from Apple's side. We've always been happy to pay Apple for hosting our application on the App Store, as all developers have always needed to do via the $99/year developer fee. But being forced to hand over 30% of the business, as well as the direct customer relationship, was always an unacceptable overreach.\n\nNow that's been arrested by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers from the United States District Court of Northern California, who has delivered app developers the only real relief that we've seen in this whole sordid monopoly affair that's been boiling since 2020. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nIt also offers Apple an opportunity to bury the hatchet with developers. They can choose to accept the court's decision in full and worldwide. Allow developers everywhere the right to link to their own billing flow, so they can retain their own customer relationship, and so business models that can't carry a 30% toll can flourish.\n\nBesides, Apple's own offering will likely still have plenty of pull. I'm sure many small developers would continue to consider IAP to avoid having to worry about international taxes or even direct customer service. Nobody is taking that away from Apple or those developers. All Judge Rogers is demanding is that Apple compete fairly with alternative arrangements.\n\nIn case Apple doesn't accept the court's decision — and there's sadly some evidence to that — I hope the European antitrust regulators watch the simple yet powerful mechanism that Judge Rogers has imposed on Apple. While I'd love side loading as much as the next sovereign techie who wants to own the hardware I buy, I think we can get the lion's share of independence by simply being allowed to link out of the apps, just like has been so ordered by this District Court.\n\nI do hope, though, that Apple does accept the court's decision. Both because it would be a stain on their reputation to get convicted of criminal contempt of court, but also because I really want Apple to return to being a shining city on the hill. To show that you can win in the market merely by making better products. Something Apple never used to be afraid of doing. That they don't need these gangster extortion techniques to make the numbers that Cook has promised Wall Street.\n\nDespite moving on to Linux and Android, I have a real soft spot for Apple's taste, aesthetics, and engineering prowess. They've lost their way and moral compass over the last half decade or so, but that's only one leadership pivot away from being found again. That won't win back all the trust and good faith that was squandered right away, but they'll at least be on the long road to recovery.\n\nWho knows, maybe developers would even be inclined to assist Apple next time they need help launching a new device in need of third-party software to succeed.",

What does the opposite look like, how would it work?\n\nIt's so easy to get stuck in a groove of what works, what you believe to be right. But helpful assumptions have a half-life, just like facts. And it's ever so easy to miss the shift when circumstances change, if you're not regularly stress-testing your core beliefs.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're just a flag in the wind, blowing whichever way. But it does mean having enough intellectual humility and creative flexibility to consider that what you believe to be true about your business, about your team, about your technology might not be so.\n\nWe did this a while back with full-time managers. We'd been working for nearly two decades without any, but exactly because it'd been so long, we were drawn to try the opposite, just to see what we might have missed. So we did. Hired a few full-time managers to help us test that assumption for a few years.\n\nIn the end, we decided that our managers-of-one culture worked better, but it wasn't a given at the outset. To try the opposite, you really have to believe that you might have been wrong.\n\nBecause you're wrong about something. I guarantee it. We all are.",

    "url": "https://world.hey.com/dhh/cheap-mini-pcs-have-gotten-really-good-c70ab40f",
    "description": "For the past week, I've been working off the Minisforum UM870. A tiny mini PC with an 8-core/16-thread AMD 8745H CPU, which retails for $343 (or €379) as a bare-bone unit, and stays below $550, even after adding 48GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. I'm shocked to report that I really don't need more than this!\n\nI mean, I knew that Apple's Mac Mini, which is equally petite to the Minisforum, had plenty of power for macOS. But somehow I thought Apple had some special sauce that made this possible, and that PCs were forever condemned to be bigger, louder, and slower. How 2020 of me.\n\nThe UM870 is a little beast. It runs our full HEY test suite in just 2m28s. In comparison, it takes a 14-core M4 Pro 2m49s, and such an Apple costs $2,199, once you've given it 48GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.\n\nNow, that M4 Mac Mini can probably do things with, say, 8K video editing that the UM870 can't touch. But on the other hand, the UM870 can play the latest video games. Everything from Fortnite to Cyberpunk 2077 to Forza Horizon. It won't trouble a modern, dedicated Nvidia card for max FPS, but it's perfectly playable at 1080p at medium settings in a ton of games.\n\nIn raw CPU power, the AMD 8745H will match a regular M4 in multi-core. They both clock in right around 13,000 points on Geekbench 6. Though the M4 is a fair bit quicker in single-core. The AMD is also far behind an M4 Pro in raw multi-core power (13K vs 22K), but at less than a quarter the cost, it's hard to complain.\n\nBut as with the example of video games, it's often deceiving just to compare the Geekbench numbers, because it all depends on what you're doing. If you're really into video games, it's no use to have extra grunt, if your favorite games won't run. The same is true if you're a developer working with Docker containers and a Linux toolchain. As quoted above, the UM870 handily defeats the M4 Pro in our all-cores-buzzing HEY test suite.\n\nThat's partly because we run databases and accessories, like MySQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch, in Docker containers. Even though we run the Ruby code natively on both platforms, the Docker dependencies put the Mac further behind than it otherwise would have been, because Linux runs Docker natively, and the Mac has to deal with the file-system tax and other drawbacks.\n\nThe irony is that it was partly Apple's volume with and investment in TSMC that got us these incredible AMD chips, as they're riding the same improvements in TSMC manufacturing prowess as Apple's M chips. The Zen 4 cores in the 8745H are all forged on the same 5nm process as the M2, so it's no surprise that the AMD cores are dead-on-the-money for Apple's in Geekbench single-core performance.\n\nAnd Zen 4 is even the last generation! The insane new (and insanely named) AMD Ryzen AI Max 395+ chip that's used in the upcoming Framework Desktop runs on Zen 5 cores. And with 16 of those, the 395+ is faster in Geekbench multi-core than an M4 Pro, and only ever so slightly behind the M4 Max. On my HEY test suite, it completes the run in an insane 1m21s — more than twice as fast as the 14-core M4 Pro!\n\nBut I digress. The 395+ chip isn't cheap, even if it's still a great deal. The Framework Desktop with 64GB/1TB, which is twice as fast as the M4 Pro with our HEY tests, is $1,744. That's still less than the $2,199 Mac Mini, which only has 48GB of RAM. But obviously way more than a $550 Minisforum! And while it's quite small, it's not tiny, like the UM870.\n\nRegardless, this is what I love about technology. I love when our assumptions are tested: just how small and cheap can an awesome developer machine become? I love that open-source Linux is able to run laps around Apple in the workloads that many developers need (like working with Docker containers). I love that this tiny little silent $550 mini PC on my desk is capable of putting out computing power that only a decade ago would have been reserved to loud, honking metal in a data center.\n\nMini PCs have gotten really good. AMD is on a roll. Linux is a blast. These are my conclusions. Check out the Minisforum UM870 or the Beelink SER8. Anything with an AMD 7745H and up to an 8945HS should be a great deal. If you want to splurge (yet still get a bargain compared to the macs), you could have a look at the new HX370 in the Beelink SER9 or Minisforum X1, but I'd save my money, buy a Lofree Flow84 keyboard to go with the new mini rig, and put the rest of the money towards a KEF LSX II savings fund!\nUpdate: The MediaTek Wifi + Bluetooth card used in the UM870 isn't compatible with Ubuntu out of the box. I run everything hardwired for performance, so didn't notice during my testing, but a reader caught it, and I confirmed it. \nIf you need wireless out-of-the-box on Ubuntu, I found that the card in the Beelink SER9 works great with both. If you already have a UM870 or still want one, and you need wireless, you could buy the AMD RZ616 Wi-Fi 6E card from Framework or Amazon for around $20 — that works and slots right in.",

    "description": "🍦 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目。我们关注投资，更关注如何更好地生活。我是雨白。\n\n最近我迷上了各种餐饮咨询类的直播，什么品类都有。看得多了才意识到，原本我以为「开店难」已经是当下的共识，尤其是开餐饮店。但实际上，想开店的人依然络绎不绝。这也解释了，为什么我们身边的餐厅一旦关门，很快就会被新店取代。有些街区甚至密集到一条街上开出十几家咖啡馆。\n\n就在这时候，我认识了苗苗。她的经历非常有意思：曾是一位消费赛道的投资人，后来亲自下场创业开了连锁咖啡馆和意大利餐厅。值得一提的是，这两门生意至今还在运转，而且都在赚钱。如今她开始独立做餐饮投资，也做得很出色。\n\n苗苗有两个颇为反直觉的观点吸引了我。第一，当大多数人都在感叹2025年餐饮不好做的时候，她却用一贯平静的语气说餐饮是个好生意，现金流非常充足。第二，当所有人都在提倡长期主义、想要打造一家百年老店时，她却说做餐饮必须坚持短期主义。在她看来，一家店的生命周期最多三年，绝不恋战。\n\n作为一档倡导成长型思维的播客，我们从不设限思维边界。我特别邀请了这位宝藏嘉宾，来聊聊她在餐饮行业里的思考与实践，也许其中的一两点，能对你有所启发。同时我还请来了我们共同的好友，「企鹅吃喝指南」的创始人志伟老师，三人一起坐下来聊聊：2025 年的餐饮行业发生了哪些变化？到底怎样才能开一家赚钱的餐厅？我们对餐饮行业还有哪些「看似理所当然、实则大有偏差」的误解。\n\n如果你觉得这期节目对你有启发，也欢迎你把它分享给那些有开店想法的亲朋好友，相信 TA 们会感谢你的。\n\n🥛 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍹 本期嘉宾\n\n苗苗：前消费股权从业者，现独立餐饮投资人\n\n志伟：「企鹅吃喝指南」创始人\n\n🍴 时间轴\n\n04:23  财务上的短期主义，是一个餐饮人长期发展的必要基石\n\n09:26 新手开店误区 01：开一家小店，不求大富大贵，只求绿水长流\n\n12:43 新手开店误区 02：自己看店好累啊，请个职业经理人来管吧\n\n16:18 「做餐饮和炒股，真的很像」\n\n24:16  如果你是第一次进入餐饮业：算好账，全职干，少投钱\n\n31:04 从二八原则到一九原则，是什么加剧了餐饮行业的竞争与分化？\n\n39:36 奶茶和咖啡，过去 20 年餐饮业里为数不多的好赛道\n\n43:15 运营好一家餐饮店，有点像谈恋爱：保持出品稳定，别出幺蛾子，不定期给用户提供新鲜感\n\n49:01 如何选择品类？先看供需关系\n\n59:35 品牌加盟「搭便车」？对普通人来说，这极有可能成为亏钱的开端\n\n64:08 社交媒体上刷到「外卖判官」帖：嘎嘎乐；开店后遇到职业差评师：笑不出来\n\n76:59  好吃很重要，但没那么重要：抛开主观感受，回到客观的市场角度，才能做好餐饮投资\n\n🔍 猜你想看\n\n往期餐饮/开店相关节目——\n\nE56 都说开店不赚钱，餐厅到底还是一个好生意吗？\n\nE115 开店暴「负」三件套：算小生意帐、沿用上班思维，以及，哎你听完节目就知道了\n\nE126 花 100 万去美国开热狗店，四个月回本却遭同行举报关门？听潘子返场讲她的海外开店之旅！\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🧰 家庭财务工具箱\n\n为未来设定清晰目标，随不同的阶段调整步伐，如实记录当下——这样的规划，或许正是我们掌控生活的开始。\n\n我们 有知有行 App 的有行模块，已经逐步升级成为了你的家庭财务工具箱。这套工具箱可以帮助你更直观地记录和看见自己有多少钱，你的家庭资产是如何分布的，分配得是否合理，以及你是否有把家庭资产暴露在了不必要的风险之中。\n\n如果你是新用户，我们尤其推荐你从家庭资产记账开始，也许你会发现自己比想象中的更有钱。\n\n升级 有知有行 App 到最新版本，就可以体验到了，去试试看，希望你会喜欢。\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 苗苗、志伟｜主持 雨白｜后期 甜食｜制作 雨烨 星星｜单集封面 ChatGPT-4o\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "description": "在历史的长河中，长城不仅是一座雄伟的军事防御工程，更是中原农耕文化与北方游牧文化交融碰撞的见证者。蒙东大环线这片广袤的土地，跨越了历史的长河，承载着丰富的文化遗产，从秦汉到明清，形成了独特的自然与社会景观。而在这片土地上，晋文化以其独特气质深深扎根，影响着当地的生活方式和思想观念。\n\n为什么说长城是军事设施，也是综合的交通和后勤体系？燕山山脉和西辽河谷地，如何塑造了当地独特的农牧交错文化？为什么蒙东大环线沿线的方言、饮食和生活习惯会呈现出惊人的相似与丰富的多样性？在本期节目中，何必与五花王将带领我们回顾各自的蒙东环线之旅，深入探讨蒙东大环线的历史变迁、地理环境与文化传承。通过东北人和晋北人的视角碰撞，东部长城沿线地带的历史与风土人情将逐渐变得鲜活而具体。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n主播：何必（北京大学历史学博士）\n\n嘉宾：五花王（职业投资人）\n\n【收听指南】\n\n02:12 五花王：北行三次自驾旅行路线\n\n09:11何必：消失省份“热河”环游之旅\n\n12:01 通辽饸饹面混合了东北和晋北要素\n\n15:14 这很山西：莜面、豆面、荞面、浑源凉粉…\n\n19:15 做饸饹，以前靠自重，现在靠电动\n\n22:04 东北粘豆包和山西的素糕、黄糕\n\n27:13 随晋商传播：鸡蛋碰糕、巴盟烩菜\n\n29:42 长城是军事设施，也是交通后勤体系\n\n34:24 从北魏到清代的边疆统治与军事战略\n\n40:30 东路最好的是热河，西路最好的是绥远\n\n44:12 提起万里茶道，最绕不开的就是晋商\n\n48:41 清代长城沿线贸易与交通体系的演变\n\n53:37 何为“板升”、“板升农业”？\n\n59:46 不同的取暖方式：火塘、火盆、火墙、地暖、炕…\n\n01:07:19 扣箱、伙计、量黄米，都跟驼队有关\n\n图：《大决战之辽沈战役》中用来挡子弹的扣箱\n\n01:14:33 围绕“烧锅（酿酒）”形成的金融+武力中心\n\n01:19:13 由保温车衍生出的回程产业循环链\n\n01:21:32 晋北与“契丹环线”的文化和历史关联\n\n01:31:52 中原地区受北宋行政区划的影响很大\n\n【工具箱】\n\n01 九边，又称九镇、明朝九边，是明弘治年间在北部沿长城防线陆续设立的九个军事重镇。从开平卫内迁到嘉靖二十一年，九边重镇是指东起鸭绿江，西抵嘉峪关，绵亘万里的北部边防线上相继设立了辽东镇、蓟州镇、宣府镇、大同镇、偏头关（也称山西镇或三关镇）、延绥镇（也称榆林镇）、宁夏镇、固原镇（也称陕西镇）、甘肃镇九个边防重镇。\n\n02 热河成立于1928年，简称热，省会承德市，位于目前河北省、辽宁省和内蒙古自治区交界地带。1955年7月热河被撤销，原热河省所属承德市及承德、平泉、青龙、兴隆、滦平、丰宁、隆化、围场等8县划归河北省；建昌、凌源、建平、朝阳、北票等5县及喀喇沁左旗划归辽宁省；赤峰、乌丹、宁城3县及敖汉旗、喀喇沁旗、翁牛特旗3旗划归内蒙古自治区。\n\n03 《地虎噬天王：后金崛起的地理与自然环境综述》一书作者是秋原。在秋原眼中，明清战争史不仅是一部军事史，也是明朝制度史、经济史的延续；决定战争结局的因素，也远不止战场上的金戈铁马、运筹帷幄。构成辽东各方势力矛盾核心的，是明帝国和李氏朝鲜双方马市贸易体系驱动下对包括市场、特产、商路在内的各种经济要素的争夺，体现为各方的人口迁移、兵力运动、城塞布置等等。\n\n04 杀虎口，也称西口。位于山西省朔州市右玉县境内，紧邻晋蒙两省交接处，杀虎口两侧高山对峙，地形十分险峻，其东依塘子山，西傍大堡山，两山之间开阔的苍头河谷地，自古便是南北重要通道，大同至呼和浩特的公路，仍经由此地，建于明朝，是明长城北部的关口之一。古称参合口。\n\n05 宁武关，位于山西省忻州市，是一个北方关隘，外三关之一，地处晋北楼烦（古部落名）故地。战国时，赵武灵王曾在此置楼烦关，以防匈奴。秦汉为楼烦县地，置有楼烦关，今县南的宁化村，即为楼烦关南口，县北的阳方口，即为楼烦关北口。北魏时广宁、神武二郡先后治此，合称宁武。唐置宁武郡，始用宁武之称，取广宁、神武二郡尾字而得。\n\n【相关往期】\n\nVol.224｜铁路的AB面：城市的桥梁与伤口｜嘉宾：五花王\n\nVol.222｜出矿区记：技术、资本与能源行业变迁｜嘉宾：五花王\n\nVol.49丨“帝国之钥”山西：古代中国政治秩序的发动机\n\nVol.38丨热河访古：站在草原望“北京”\n\nVol.30丨在中国地图上消失了的“塞北四省”\n\nVol.26丨北中国旅行指南（下）\n\nVol.25丨北中国旅行指南（上）\n\nVol.19丨带你走进鲜为人知的山西\n\nVol.12丨怎么保卫北京？守住山西！\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台关注我们。欢迎多多留言评论，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：media@eidos.wiki",

    "url": "http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/05/weekly-issue-348.html",
    "description": "这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。\n本杂志开源，欢迎投稿。另有《谁在招人》服务，发布程序员招聘信息。合作请邮件联系（yifeng.ruan@gmail.com）。\n封面图\n\n5月1日，宇宙飞船造型的深圳科技馆新馆开馆，上图是设计团队在新馆前合影。（via）\n李飞飞，从移民到 AI 明星\n大家知道李飞飞吧，AI 的明星教授。\n\n她在斯坦福大学任教，是美国国家工程院等三院院士，担任过斯坦福 AI 实验室主任，以及谷歌云 AI 首席科学家。\n她1976年出生于北京，在成都长大，16岁全家移民美国。\n我一直好奇，她怎么走上 AI 这条路，从移民变成学术明星？\n\n这几天，我读完她的自传《我看见的世界》（中信出版集团，2024），才发现她的人生很有戏剧性，每当重要关头，都有幸运的事情发生。\n（1）高中阶段\n她出生于一个普通家庭，中学阶段并无过人之处。\n我们家位于成都当时的外环路旁边，小区由三栋一模一样的塔楼组成，我家住在四楼。这个环路是不断扩张的城市边缘，一侧是工厂，另一侧是农田。\n我进入了一所吸引全市优秀学生的中学。在那几年里，对女孩的预设和偏见让我越来越不耐烦，这种情绪已经超出了课业的范围。在同龄人中，我已经有\"假小子\"的称号。\n1992年，移民美国后，她家的生活顿时变得困难。一家三口挤在新泽西乡下一间一居室公寓，她睡客厅，床就放在餐桌旁边。\n父亲在一家华人商店修理旧相机，后来被辞退，从此失业。母亲做杂货店营业员，后因风湿性心脏病，回家休养。李飞飞下课后，就要去打工，有时在中餐馆端盘子12个小时，每小时2美元。\n最后，实在走投无路，她们家决定买下社区的一家干洗店，靠洗衣为生。买下干洗店需要10万美元，全家仅有2万美元储蓄，其余8万美元都是借的。\n（2）大学阶段\n1997年，李飞飞中学毕业，要申请大学了。\n一开始，我的目标大学主要是州立大学和社区大学，而不是常春藤学校。但我一直对一所顶级高校念念不忘，那就是普林斯顿大学。\n我们是一个靠从车库市场淘来的旧货才能勉强度日的家庭，连我用的计算器都是坏的，我们怎么可能负担得起常春藤学校的学费呢？\n尽管如此，我还是无法抑制内心的冲动，提交了申请。就算只是象征性地申请一下，我也感觉具有特殊意义。\n她申请了普林斯顿大学，结果好梦成真，普林斯顿给了全额奖学金。\n如果没有全奖，以她家的经济状况，负担不了学费。如果不去普林斯顿大学，她就不太可能走上学术道路了，更不要说后面的成就了。\n（3）博士阶段\n大学毕业后，李飞飞原想去华尔街工作，解决家庭的经济问题。\n母亲鼓励她，继续追求自己的梦想。于是，她选择去加州理工学院读研究生，方向是视觉识别机制。\n2004年，李飞飞为了写博士论文，需要图片材料，来训练算法。她找了9000张图片，组成了一个图片集，手工对每张图片进行分类标注，一共分成101类。\n这个图片集叫做 Caltech 101，算法经过训练，就能从新图片识别出这101类物品。她因此顺利拿到了博士学位。\n（4）助教阶段\n博士毕业后，李飞飞先去伊利诺伊大学，后去普林斯顿大学，都是担任计算机科学的助教。\n她继续探索视觉识别，想找到一种通用算法，能够识别所有种类的物品，而不是 Caltech 101 那样，只能识别出101类物品。\n这意味着她需要一个超大的图片训练集，能够包含了世界上所有物品。这可太难了，所有人都反对这件事。\n我们都是年轻的助理教授，所处的院系竞争激烈，在事业起步的那几年里，我们都面临着\"要么发表论文，要么完蛋走人\"的局面。压力之下，我们必须马不停蹄、保质保量地完成工作，因为我们知道，稍有懈怠就可能与终身教授的职位说再见，一同失去的还有获得稳定生计的最佳机会。\n我听到的劝阻之声已经多得够我用一辈子了（可能下辈子也够了）.\n有上万个类别的数据集有什么用？大部分模型连一两个类别都识别不准！\n你知道用这么多图像训练一个模型要花多长时间吗？这个时间可是用\"年\"来计算的。\n别人要怎么下载呢？你这个图像总量比大多数硬盘的存储量还要大。\n具体怎么做，你有计划了吗？几百万张图谁来做标注？要花多长时间？怎么验证所有内容的准确性呢？\n（5）ImageNet\n李飞飞坚持要做，这个通用图片集起名为 ImageNet。那时是2006年。\n她想到一个思路，英语词典有一些基本名词，用来解释其他所有物品。只要统计一下，基本名词有多少个，每一个又有多少变体，那就得到了所有物品的基本类别。\n统计结果是3万类。因此，李飞飞估计，ImageNet 将有3万个类别，总共包含2000万张图片，每张图片都要有分类和标注，需要从几亿张图片里面筛选出来。\n我们发出了邮件，招募愿意帮忙从网上下载和标注图片的本科生，工作时间灵活，每小时10美元。我们招募到一些学生，但是按照这样的进度，完成整个项目需要19年。\n这太慢了，项目方法做了改进，用脚本自动去谷歌搜索图片，然后抓取。但是这样也需要人工核对和筛选，只把19年的时间缩短到18年。\n幸运的是，亚马逊刚刚发布了众包平台\"土耳其机器人\"（Amazon Mechanical Turk，AMT）。在这个平台上，你可以出钱，通过互联网，把任务分包给世界各地接活的人。\n他们通过这个平台，将 ImageNet 分包出去，投入的人数一下子扩展到几千人，而人均费用只是原来的几十分之一。\n2009年6月，ImageNet 的初始版本终于完成了。我们成功达成了目标：收集了1500万张图片，涵盖了2.2万个不同类别。这些图片筛选自近10亿张候选图片，并由来自167个国家的4.8万多名全球贡献者进行了标注。\n（6）ILSVRC 算法竞赛\nImageNet 虽然完成了，但在学术界毫无反响，没有太多人关注。\n我们遇到了第一个也是最严重的挫折：在当年的\"计算机视觉与模式识别大会\"上，ImageNet 被降级为\"海报展示\"。\n所谓的\"海报展示\"是一个学术术语，意味着我们将不能在演讲厅内向听众展示我们的工作，只能在会场的指定区域里摆放一幅印有项目摘要的大幅海报，希望能引起路人的兴趣。\n我想过 ImageNet 可能被证明是对的，也可能被证明是错的，对于这两种可能性，我都做好了准备。无论是哪种结果，都会是一个学习的机会。然而，我万万没想到，它被忽视了。\n由于 ImageNet 得不到承认，李飞飞想到一个办法，她要每年举行一次算法比赛，看看哪种算法识别 ImageNet 图片集的正确率最高。\n这样一来，在计算机视觉领域，ImageNet 就会成为一个比较基准，各种算法都需要用它表示自己的识别能力，大家就不会忽视它了。这个比赛叫做 ILSVRC（ImageNet 大型视觉识别挑战赛，ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge）。\n2010年，第一届比赛令人失望，11个团队提交了35个参赛算法。冠军算法是传统的图片向量比较，并无创新之处，正确率也不高。\n2011年，第二届比赛更惨，获胜算法还是图片向量比较，正确率只提高了2个百分点。这意味着，没有任何创新和进展。\n最糟糕的是，参赛人数也出现急剧下降，参赛算法从35个减少到15个，愿意为此付出努力的人似乎越来越少。\n说这种经历\"让人羞愧\"已经远远不足以描述我们的心情了。为了推动 ImageNet 的发展，我们倾注了多年的心血，搜集的图片数量远远超过以往的任何数据集，还精心策划了一场国际竞赛来探索它的能力，但结果却只是简单地重复了现状。如果说ImageNet 是一场赌注，是时候开始思考我们是不是已经输了。\n眼看这个项目就要失败了，几年的心血付之东流。就在这个时候，李飞飞人生最大的惊喜和反转来临了。\n2012年，第三届比赛，一个加拿大团队使用被学术界遗忘已久的卷积神经网络，一举将图片识别正确率提高了10%。\n接下来的事情，就是被写进教科书的历史了。全世界被神经网络的效果轰动了，AI 研究出现突破，人类进入 AI 时代。\n李飞飞彻底翻身，一举成名，从助教变成世界知名的 AI 研究领头人物，人生从此海阔天空。\n她的故事令人感叹，如果神经网络算法没有在2012年出现，而是再晚几年，或者更早一点，亚马逊的土耳其机器人众包平台没有在2005年诞生，一切会怎样？\n这就是时运吧。科学家的人生和科学发现一样，都是由一些偶然事件推动的。个人奋斗固然重要，但是关键时刻还是离不开幸运。\n科技动态\n（1）传统的脑电图，需要在头上布满电极（下图），有很多限制，也不舒适。\n\n美国宾州大学的科学家，发明了一种头发电极，细得像头发一样，可以直接粘在皮肤上，淋浴和运动也不会掉下。\n\n这种电极目前还是有线的，但是有计划开发无线版本。\n（2）百度地图在导航路面植入广告。\n\n（3）谷歌的 AI 笔记应用 NotebookLM，可能很快就会添加\"视频概览\"功能。\n\n它已经支持生成音频和 AI 问答，如果再支持生成视频，简直难以想象，是否还需要真人老师。\n直接上传课本，它就生成讲课视频了。\n（4）安卓官方的桌面模式，泄露了运行照片。下图是它的多窗口模式。\n\n但是 Android 16 可能来不及，发布要等到 Android 17。\n\n手机当作桌面电脑，已经不远了。\n（5）百度公布\"动物语言转换方法、装置、电子设备及存储介质\"专利，使用 AI 识别动物的情感状态，转换为人类能够理解的语言，从而实现动物与人类之间的情感交流和理解。\n\n\n文章\n1、一段让 Chromium 机器人崩溃的代码（英文）\n\n作者介绍了一段 JS 代码，让Chromium 无头浏览器（Puppeteer 和 Playwright）崩溃。它可以用来识别，访问者是不是机器人。\n2、Git worktree 简介（英文）\n\nGit 仓库同时只能有一个工作区，如果想同时建立多个工作区，可以使用 git worktree 命令。\n3、用 Go 移植 TypeScript 的重要影响（中文）\n\n微软官方要用 Go 语言重写 TypeScript 项目，本文分析这样做的目的和影响。（@imbant 投稿）\n4、为什么大模型可以控制手机（中文）\n\n开源项目 droidrun 可以通过大模型，以自然语言操作安卓手机的 APP。本文分析它是如何做到的。（@lezhi12 投稿）\n5、创业公司可能无法承受微服务（英文）\n\n本文提出，微服务需要很强的运维能力，并会增加代码复杂性，创业公司不要盲目采用，单体应用更简单。\n6、从 Prettier 和 ESLint 迁移到 BiomeJS（英文）\n\nBiomeJS 是用 Rust 语言写的工具，对 JS 代码进行格式化和语法检查，速度极快，可以取代 Prettier 和 ESLint。\n7、如何自己托管 Obsidian（英文）\n\nObsidian 是一个优秀的笔记软件，作者给出详细步骤，自己托管 Obsidian 服务器，从而在任何地方都可以通过浏览器使用。\n工具\n1、Void\n\n开源的 AI 代码编辑器，Cursor 的替代品，基于 VS Code。\n2、Hyvector\n\n在线的矢量图（SVG 文件）编辑工具。\n3、Karakeep\n\n一个自搭建的书签 App，提供全文搜索和 AI 自动分类标签，参见介绍文章。\n4、PairDrop\n\n局域网传输文件的 Web 应用，代码开源，类似于 ShareDrop 和 LocalSend。\n5、zVault\n\nNAS 操作系统 TrueNAS 原本基于 FreeBSD，正在转向 Linux。zVault 是一个社区的分支，由社区推动继续在 FreeBSD 开发。\n6、YAMLResume\n\n使用 YAML 格式创建简历，并通过 LaTeX 输出 PDF，方便进行版本管理。（@xiaohanyu 投稿）\n7、AllinSSL\n\n开源的 SSL 证书自动化管理平台，集证书申请、管理、部署和监控于一体。（@KincaidYang 投稿） \n8、Basecoat\n\n一套基于 Shadcn UI 的组件库，但是不使用 React。\n9、Scraperr\n\n网络爬虫的 Web 控制台。\nAI 相关\n1、MathModelAgent\n\n开源的 AI 应用，自动完成数学建模，生成一份完整的论文。（@jihe520 投稿）\n2、BiliFilter\n基于本地大模型的 Bilibili 弹幕过滤器，对弹幕分类过滤。（@ddddng 投稿）\n3、AI 语音克隆\n\n免费的语音克隆工具，3 秒录音克隆人声。（@xiaodaidai0701 投稿）\n资源\n1、I Don't Have Spotify\n\n一个音乐搜索引擎，输入 Spotify、YouTube、Apple、SoundCloud 的音乐链接，它会提供该音乐在其他网站的链接。\n2、IPinfo Lite\n\n地理位置数据库 IPinfo 推出的免费服务，IP 查询地理位置，无需信用卡，API 请求次数不受限制。\n1、Web Component 教程\n\n英文的 Web Component 入门教程。\n图片\n1、数字键盘的样式\n数字键盘来源于电话。\n早期的电话都采用旋转的拨号盘。20世纪50年代，电话可以长途直拨了，拨打长途电话需要输入11个号码，拨号盘就太麻烦了，导致了数字键盘的诞生。\n1955年，AT&T 公司的研究人员，做过一个研究，10个数字的小键盘应该怎样排列，效率最高？\n他们一共列出了15种排列。\n\n经过研究和比较，用户更喜欢从左到右、从上到下的布局。\n具体来说，两排五列水平布局与现在普遍使用的 3x3+1 布局速度相当，差异很小。\nAT&T 公司最终为电话选择了 3x3+1 布局，主要原因大概是它比较紧凑。\n文摘\n1、我第一次加入创业公司的教训\n一位开发者大学毕业后，加入了一家创业公司。\n他逐渐发现，公司内部有很多矛盾，产品决策也有失误。\n最终，公司开始走下坡路，他就提交了辞呈，放弃了自己的期权。\n离职后，他写了一篇文章，总结了自己得到的教训。\n\n（1）即使创业公司的每个员工都很有动力，但如果创始人并非顶尖人才，那么取得巨大成功的机会很低（但你仍然可以从中学到很多东西）。\n（2）创业公司只有两种工作：开发和销售。如果创始人既不做开发，也不做销售，不知道他在做什么，那就相信你的直觉吧。\n（3）创业公司的产品还未得到市场验证的情况下，为多个平台构建原生应用，是一种极其低效的行为。如果同时为两个产品在每个平台开发两个原生应用，简直是疯了。\n（4）创业公司的路演，大多是浪费时间。产品的验证来自于与用户交流和迭代，而不是打动评委。\n（5）没有什么比并肩作战、共同实现梦想更神奇的了。如果你经常见不到创始人，所有的沟通都只能通过远程进行，那可不是好兆头。\n（6）如果创业公司没有经过严格的面试，就录用了你，这是一个危险信号。他们到底是基于能力来录用你，还是因为你是第一个同意只收很少的报酬，就为他们工作的工程师？\n言论\n1、\n科学项目日益大型化和制度化，使得个人的好奇心和创新，对于科学的推动正在减弱。科学的进步越来越依靠有效的组织和大量的投入。\n-- 《思想家和实干家》\n2、\n除非你参与过历史遗留项目，否则你不能自称高级工程师。\n-- infobip.com\n3、\n是什么让硅谷的公司如此强大？\n不仅仅是它们数十亿美元的资金或数十亿用户，也不仅仅是因为它们拥有惊人计算能力和数据储备，让学术实验室的资源相形见绌。它们之所以强大，是因为成千上万个才华横溢的人在同一个屋檐下共同努力。\n-- 《李飞飞自传》\n4、\n以前的小团队是1名高级开发人员 + 5名初级开发人员，以后是1名高级开发人员 + AI 大模型。\n-- Hacker News 读者\n5、\n我打赌，以后的工程师必须深入底层，更接近硅片的层面。开发应用程序将不再需要精通技术的人，AI 让每个人都可以开发自己的应用程序。\n-- Hacker News 读者\n往年回顾\nOpenAI

    "description": "Today, we're launching a new bug bounty program to stress-test our latest safety measures. Similar to the program we announced last summer, we're challenging researchers to find universal jailbreaks in safety classifiers that we haven't yet deployed publicly. These safeguards are part of the advanced protections we’ve developed to help us meet the AI Safety Level-3 (ASL-3) Deployment Standard as part of our Responsible Scaling Policy, the framework that governs how we develop and deploy increasingly capable AI models safely.\nThe bug bounty program, which is in partnership with HackerOne, will test an updated version of our Constitutional Classifiers system. Constitutional Classifiers are a technique we built to guard against jailbreaks that could elicit information related to CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) weapons. This system follows a list of principles that define what type of content should and shouldn’t be allowed when interacting with Claude, and focus narrowly on specific harms.\nParticipants will receive early access to test our classifiers on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. We’re offering bounty rewards up to $25,000 for verified universal jailbreaks found on the unreleased system. A universal jailbreak is a vulnerability that consistently bypasses Claude’s safety measures across many topics. For this initiative, we're interested in universal jailbreaks that could be exploited to enable misuse on CBRN-related topics.\nOur models are becoming increasingly capable, and as we’ve shared before, we believe some future models may require the advanced ASL-3 security and safety protections outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy. This bug bounty initiative will help contribute to the work we’ve done over the last several months to iterate and stress-test our ASL-3 safeguards.\nWe’ve kicked off this new bug bounty initiative with participation from the researchers who joined our earlier program last year and are offering the opportunity for new researchers to participate. If you're an experienced red teamer or have demonstrated expertise in identifying jailbreaks in language models, we encourage you to apply for an invitation through our application form. Detailed instructions and feedback will be shared with selected participants. Applications open today, and the program will run through Sunday, May 18. This initiative is invite-only so we can respond to submissions with timely feedback.\nWe're grateful to the security community for its partnership in helping us make AI systems safer.\nUpdate on May 22, 2025\nThe bug bounty program in this post has concluded. Participants will transition to a new bug bounty initiative we’re rolling out today that’s focused on stress-testing our Constitutional Classifiers system on the new Claude Opus 4 model and testing other safety systems we may develop. We’re still accepting applications to participate in this new invite-only program. You can apply for an invite through our application form.\nTo further advance AI safety, we are also accepting reports of universal jailbreaks for ASL-3 uses of concern (meaning those which elicit information related to biological threats) found on public platforms or forums, such as social media. For more information, see here.",

    "title": "Coding should be a vibe!",
    "url": "https://world.hey.com/dhh/coding-should-be-a-vibe-50908f49",
    "description": "The appeal of \"vibe coding\" — where programmers lean back and prompt their way through an entire project with AI — appears partly to be based on the fact that so many development environments are deeply unpleasant to work with.\n\nSo it's no wonder that all these programmers stuck working with cumbersome languages and frameworks can't wait to give up on the coding part of software development. If I found writing code a chore, I'd be looking for retirement too.\n\nBut I don't.\n\nI mean, I used to! When I started programming, it was purely because I wanted programs. Learning to code was a necessary but inconvenient step toward bringing systems to life. That all changed when I learned Ruby and built Rails.\n\nRuby's entire premise is \"programmer happiness\": that writing code should be a joy. And historically, the language was willing to trade run-time performance, memory usage, and other machine sympathies against the pursuit of said programmer happiness. These days, it seems like you can eat your cake and have it too, though. Ruby, after thirty years of constant improvement, is now incredibly fast and efficient, yet remains a delight to work with.\n\nThat ethos couldn't shine brighter now. Disgruntled programmers have finally realized that an escape from nasty syntax, boilerplate galore, and ecosystem hyper-churn is possible. That's the appeal of AI: having it hide away all that unpleasantness. Only it's like cleaning your room by stuffing the mess under the bed — it doesn't make it go away!\n\nBut the instinct is correct: Programming should be a vibe! It should be fun! It should resemble English closely enough that line noise doesn't obscure the underlying ideas and decisions. It should allow a richness of expression that serves the human reader instead of favoring the strictness preferred by the computer. Ruby does.\n\nAnd given that, I have no interest in giving up writing code. That's not the unpleasant part that I want AI to take off my hands. Just so I can — what? — become a project manager for a murder of AI crows? I've had the option to retreat up the manager ladder for most of my career, but I've steadily refused, because I really like writing Ruby! It's the most enjoyable part of the job!\n\nThat doesn't mean AI doesn't have a role to play when writing Ruby. I'm conversing and collaborating with LLMs all day long — looking up APIs, clarifying concepts, and asking stupid questions. AI is a superb pair programmer, but I'd retire before permanently handing it the keyboard to drive the code.\n\nMaybe one day, wanting to write code will be a quaint concept. Like tending to horses for transportation in the modern world — done as a hobby but devoid of any economic value.\n\nI don't think anyone knows just how far we can push the intelligence and creativity of these insatiable token munchers. And I wouldn't bet against their advance, but it's clear to me that a big part of their appeal to programmers is the wisdom that Ruby was founded on: Programming should favor and flatter the human.",

If so, have you used it in production?\nIt’s a field with excellent potential – who wouldn’t want to use an approach that combines the strengths of dense and term-based text retrieval? Yet it’s not so popular. Is it due to the common curse of “What looks good on paper is not going to work in practice”??\nThis article describes our path towards sparse neural retrieval as it should be – lightweight term-based retrievers capable of distinguishing word meanings.",

    "description": "「从拼单颗芯片的性能，到优化多芯片互联的系统。」\n\nAI 算力，现在是中美都最关注的 AI 底层竞争力。约 1 个月前，华为推出由 384 块昇腾 910 互联而成的/超节点 AI 集群，CloudMatrix 384。\n\n\n图注：这是超节点发布会上展示的 CloudMatrix 服务器机柜组，如播客中介绍的，一共是 12 台机柜（每台机柜里又有 4 个服务器），中间有光纤、交换机等部件连接。\n\n华为超节点发布后不久，我邀请有 20 多年芯片从业经验的徐凌杰来一起聊一聊这项算力底层的新变化。\n\n自 2000 年代中期，徐凌杰先后在英伟达、AMD 和三星，参与设计 GPU 架构。后来加入阿里云，领导GPU 云计算基础设施的搭建；2019 年与张文等人联合创立国产 GPU 公司壁仞科技；2024 年开始新创业，成立魔形智能，专注 AI 算力集群产品设计和优化。\n\n超节点本身就是一种从拼单芯片性能，到优化整个节点和机架的算力思路变化，徐凌杰的从业经验正好匹配了这一趋势。\n\n本期节目的第一部分，我们聊了华为 CloudMatrix 384 是什么，它和英伟达 2024 年开始重磅推出的集群方案 NVL72 的异同。不止英伟达、华为，把节点做得越来越大，从集群芯片数量要性能，以网络能力弥补计算和存储的瓶颈，已成为算力市场的共识性趋势。\n\n在第二部分，我们则主要讨论了超节点趋势，对英伟达、对其它国产芯片，对整个 AI 算力市场的可能影响，和一个“经典问题”：下一个改变算力格局的变量可能是什么？\n\n节目录制后不久，华为超节点开始出货。据《金融时报》报道，一套完整的  CloudMatrix 384 售价约 800 万美元，是售价约 300 万美元的 NVL72 的 2 倍多。但要注意，这并不是华为的官方价格信息。\n\n5 月 7 日，华为盘古大模型团队又在预印本平台 Arxiv 发表了一篇论文，称在 6000 多块昇腾芯片组成的超大集群上，实现了 7180 亿（718B）参数 MoE 模型的长期稳定训练。\n\n本期嘉宾：\n徐凌杰，魔形智能CEO，邮箱：lingjie@magikcompute.ai\n\n时间线跳转：\n- 华为 Cloud 384 集群 & 把节点做大的趋势\n03:15 CloudMatrix 384 是什么？Scale up vs Scale out\n08:33 算力底层构成，不止 GPU，还有互联、网络、冷却等综合系统\n11:09 NVLink、NVSwitch 是英伟达的另一重壁垒，69 亿美元收购 Mellanox 前后开始布局\n18:22  广义与狭义的 AI Infra\n20:38 第三方系统优化公司的机会？——同时掌握计算、网络能力的芯片原厂是少数\n22:51 “超节点”好坏，看什么指标？\n29:08 黄仁勋想推“训推一体”，实际上业界在怎么用 GPU？\n33:17 模型越大，显存压力越大——显存正成为芯片主要成本\n36:02 华为超节点功耗高，但中国电费成本相对小，以总量换性能\n38:11 华为的多卡互联来自什么积累 ——华为在成为 Nvidia 之前已是一个 Mellanox\n42:57 NV Switch 为何难？去年 AMD 49 亿美元收购 ZT 补能力\n\n- 超节点趋势，对英伟达和 AI 算力市场的影响\n45:43 华为超节点，短期不冲击英伟达，压力给到其它 AI 国产芯片商\n47:51 英伟达 H20 已计提 55 亿美元损失，但可能通过技术手段提升部分性能\n51:19 华为在阿里 Qwen3 发布当天宣布支持\n55:12 英伟达上游有全球供应链支持，下游有客户生态，危险之一是客户集中\n01:00:44 为什么 Google TPU 没有动摇英伟达的地位？\n01:04:23 可能是 Nvidia 的“防守措施”：已成立“半定制”部门\n01:06:17 为什么离开英伟达，十年前的老黄是什么样？\n01:12:01 2024 年选择创业：看到芯片周边集群优化能做出差异化，也是长坡厚雪\n01:18:44 新硬件架构的苗头？——存算一体、类脑计算（脉冲神经网络）\n\n相关链接\n一文洞悉超节点：解密AI时代的算力基\n\nPangu Ultra MoE: How to Train Your Big MoE on Ascend NPUs（盘古超级混合专家模型：如何在昇腾 NPU 上训练超大规模混合模型\n\n晚点聊 103：用 Attention 串起大模型优化史，详解DeepSeek、Kimi最新注意力机制改进\n\n晚点聊 49:3nm 是谎言？光刻工厂真能造芯片？与汪波聊芯片行业那些流传的误解\n\n晚点聊 32：最怕客户来参观的行业：和谈三圈仔细谈谈芯片\n\n附录：\nGPU、GPGPU、ASIC、NPU：都是可以做 AI 模型训练和推理的 AI 芯片。GPU 是图形处理器，GPGPU 是针对通用计算（而非图形任务）优化的 GPU，AISC 是专用集成电路，它的性价比理论上比GPU 更好，但不如 GPU 通用；NPU（Neural Processing Unit）也是一种 ASIC。\nDPU（Data Processing Unit）：：数据处理单元，用于优化网络通信、安全和存储操作，减轻 CPU和 GPU 的负担，提升AI 算力中心整体性能。\nGPU 的精度：如节目中提到的 FP8（（8位浮点数）、INT8（（8位浮点数） 都是 GPU 精度的一种，是不同的数据格式标准。DeepSeek-V3 和 R1 就是在预训练阶段使用了以 FP8 为主的混合低精度训练方法。\n总线（Bus）：计算机内部用于传输数据、地址和控制信号的通信系统，连接 CPU、内存和外设等组件，确保信息在各部分之间高效传递。\n高速互联协议：用于在计算系统内部或系统之间实现高速、低延迟的数据通信的协议，如英伟达的NVLink、InfiniBand（由 IBTA 协会开发）和 PCIe （由 Intel、Dell、HP、IBM 等公司成立的联盟 PCI-SIG 开发），支持大规模并行计算和数据中心的高效运行。\nMellanox：一家提供高性能互联解决方案的以色列公司，英伟达在 2019 年以 69 亿美元收购了 Mellanox。\nZT Systems：2024 年，AMD 则以 49 亿美元收购了 ZT Systems，为云计算厂商设计、制造和部署复杂的计算、存储和加速器解决方案。\nNVSwitch：英伟达推出的高带宽交换芯片，支持多 GPU 间的全互联通信，可提升系统整体性能和可扩展性。\nNVLink：英伟达开发的高速互联技术，提供高带宽、低延迟的 GPU 与 GPU、GPU 与 CPU 之间的通信，支持大规模并行计算和深度学习任务。\nDynamo：英伟达推出的开源推理软件平台，支持多种 AI 框架和硬件架构。在谈到英伟达收购 Lepton.ai 的背景时提及。\n英伟达的费米（Fermi）架构：英伟达 2010 前后开发、推出的 GPU 架构，开发过程很不顺利，经历两次流片失败。\n神经脉冲（Neuromorphic Computing）：模拟人脑神经网络结构和功能的计算方法，用脉冲神经网络处理信息，特点是高效能、低功耗。（人脑的功耗就比较低，只有 20 W 左右）\n存算一体（Compute-in-Memory）：将计算功能集成到存储器中的计算架构，减少数据在存储器和处理器之间的传输，提高计算效率和能效，适用于大规模数据处理和人工智能应用。\n\n剪辑制作：甜食、Nick\n\n本期主播：小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "“人生的路啊，怎么越走越窄……”\n\n1980年5月，《中国青年》杂志发表了一封署名潘晓的来信，其中吐露的彷徨、苦闷、迷惘和怀疑，一下子击中了刚刚经历巨变的亿万青年的心，它在数月内相继引发6万封来信，掀起了一场人生观讨论的大潮。站在45年后的今天来看，潘晓来信中所诉说的苦闷依然具有相当的普遍性，归结起来主要是两个字——虚无。\n\n潘晓来信诉说的青年苦闷与当下社会的焦虑迷惘情绪为什么如此有共性？当社会承诺的“努力即回报”默默失效，当个体主义所馈赠的自由演化为不确定的风险和虚无的重负，我们是否还能充盈自己、迈向“实心”？在本期节目中，我们邀请到大观学者、华东师范大学刘擎教授，从他所亲历的潘晓来信谈起，聊聊跟随时代演变的“空心”与“脆皮”，聊聊萨特的存在主义哲学与弗洛姆的“占有还是存在”。\n\n本期节目为企划#实心青年请就位#系列节目之一，感谢中国平安对本期节目的特别支持。海德格尔说，人不自由时不满，人自由时恐慌。但自由之后的“空心”，也许不是问题，而是“实心”的起点。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n主播：何必，北京大学历史学博士\n\n嘉宾：刘擎，大观学者，华东师范大学紫江特聘教授\n\n【收听指南】\n\n诊断：现代人的“空心”与“脆皮”\n\n03:00 《潘晓来信》：1980年代青年的迷惘\n\n06:23 讨论主题：主观为自己，客观为别人\n\n09:18 社会倡导的价值观与现实之间的差距\n\n12:34 敏感虚弱和文明发展，其实一体两面\n\n19:38 “努力未必有回报”，年轻人开始求“稳”\n\n22:37 个体主义带来自由，信仰缺失倒向虚无\n\n26:04 形而上的问题曾被掩盖，而未被解决\n\n克服：确立自我，走出“虚无”\n\n31:23 萨特的存在主义与现代人的自由重负\n\n37:27 “空心”不能靠思辨解决，但并非无解\n\n40:06 中西方历史上两次标志性的思想转向\n\n44:10 本真性的追求：回归内心、确立自我\n\n47:40 人们过去不知道有多种合理的价值观\n\n54:13 比起单纯“占有”，更重要的是去存在\n\n实践：走向“实心”，自由绽放自己的存在\n\n58:20 李娟，守护“劳动和写作一体”的自由\n\n01:04:39 阎鹤祥，追寻“跟世界贴着”的自由\n\n01:10:23 费宇，选择“身体重心灵轻”的自由\n\n01:13:18 我们都值得拥有更多“实心”的时刻\n\n【工具箱】\n\n本期提到的历史人物：马丁·路德 (Martin Luther)｜王阳明｜朱熹｜查尔斯·泰勒（Charles Taylor）｜裴多菲·山陀尔 (Petőfi Sándor)｜殷夫｜格奥尔格·齐美尔（Georg Simmel）｜约翰·罗尔斯（John Bordley Rawls）｜艾瑞克·弗洛姆 (Erich Fromm)\n\n【小助手】\n\n五四青年节，中国平安携手小宇宙App，共同呈现内容企划#实心青年请就位#。作为中国领先的综合金融集团，中国平安始终关注并陪伴青年成长，提供“保险、医疗、金融、养老”在内的全方位服务，为年轻人构建省心、省时、省钱的生活支持系统。用实心的选择回应现实的复杂，稳稳托住生活的每一步。本次企划将为听众提供关于「实心青年」的样本合辑与行动指南，愿每一个年轻人都能掌握生活主动权，在稳定的精神内核与扎实的现实支点下，追求「实心」人生，成为「实心青年」。\n\n关于节目中所提到的“平安添瑞·安有护”保险+服务解决方案，你可以通过「平安金管家」App或点击这里了解更多详情。\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台关注我们。欢迎多多留言评论，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：media@eidos.wiki",

    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search-api",
    "description": "Today, we're introducing web search on the Anthropic API—a new tool that gives Claude access to current information from across the web. With web search enabled, developers can build Claude-powered applications and agents that deliver up-to-date insights.\nPower AI agents with the latest information from the web\nDevelopers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to the Messages API.\n\n\n\nWhen Claude receives a request that would benefit from up-to-date information or specialized knowledge, it uses its reasoning capabilities to determine whether the web search tool would help provide a more accurate response. If searching the web would be beneficial, Claude generates a targeted search query, retrieves relevant results, analyzes them for key information, and provides a comprehensive answer with citations back to the source material.\nClaude can also operate agentically and conduct multiple progressive searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries in order to do light research and generate a more comprehensive answer. Developers can control this by adjusting the max_uses parameter. Behind the scenes, Claude may also refine its queries to deliver a more accurate response.\nWith web search, developers can now build AI solutions that tap into current information without needing to manage their own web search infrastructure.\nUse cases\nWeb search enables Claude to power a wide range of use cases that benefit from real-time data and specialized knowledge across various industries. Use cases include:\n\nFinancial services: Build AI agents that analyze real-time stock prices, market trends, and regulatory updates.\nLegal research: Create tools that access recent court decisions, regulatory changes, and legal news.\nDeveloper tools: Enable Claude to reference the latest API documentation, GitHub releases, and technology updates.\nProductivity: Build agents that incorporate the latest company reports, competitive intelligence, or industry research.\n\nBuild with trust and control\nEvery web-sourced response includes citations to source materials, enabling users to verify information directly. This is particularly valuable for sensitive use cases that require accuracy and accountability.\n\nOrganizations can maintain additional control through the following admin settings:\n\nDomain allow lists: Specify which domains Claude can search and retrieve information from, ensuring that results only come from approved sources.\nDomain block lists: Prevent Claude from accessing certain domains that may contain sensitive, competitive, or inappropriate content for your organization.\nOrganization-level management: Administrators can allow or prohibit web search use at the organization level.\n\nEnhance Claude Code with web search\nWeb search is also now available in Claude Code, adding the latest information from the web to development workflows.\nWith web search enabled, Claude Code can access current API documentation, technical articles, and other information on development tools and libraries. This is particularly valuable when working with new or rapidly evolving frameworks, troubleshooting obscure errors, or implementing features that require version-specific API references.\nCustomer Spotlight: Poe\nQuora is bringing web search to its AI platform, Poe.\n“Anthropic's web search tool is a welcome addition to the Poe platform. It is cost effective and delivers search results with impressive speed, which will benefit people who need access to real-time information while using Claude models on Poe,” said Spencer Chan, Head of Poe Product, Quora.\nCustomer Spotlight: Adaptive.ai\nAdaptive is an AI tool for consumers to create end-to-end apps.\n“Anthropic’s web search delivers consistently thorough results that have outperformed other tools we’ve tested. The depth and accuracy of Claude’s responses and its ability to function as a research agent will make a significant difference in how effectively we enable our customers to build web-enabled products,” said Dennis Xu, Co-founder, Adaptive.\nGetting started\nWeb search is now available on the Anthropic API for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku at $10 per 1,000 searches plus standard token costs.\nTo get started, enable the web search tool in your API requests.

    "description": "「我现在有一个判断，很多人会认为是胡说八道：在这一轮大模型热潮里，中国投资人很可能会集体 miss。」\n\n今天，《晚点聊》一次发了两期节目，嘉宾都是秘塔创始人，闵可锐。一次访谈发生在 2023 年年初，另一次是在最近。本期，是 2023 年 3 月中旬的那一次访谈。\n\n那是中国大模型热潮的开端，王慧文刚自己投资 5000 万美元，成立光年之外，月之暗面还在组建，六小龙的名号还没有兴起，DeepSeek 还没有正式成立，字节等大公司也没有充分展现对 AI 的志在必得和激进投入。\n\n秘塔当时已是一家成立近 5 年的公司，推出了法律翻译、秘塔写字猫等多款 AI 应用。现在更为人熟知的秘塔搜索则还没有上线。\n\n回顾这次发生在热潮开端的讨论，恍若隔世，也有很多先见之明。那时可锐就有一些犀利的观察和观点，包括：\n\n\n中国 VC 可能会集体 miss 掉一位最有雄心的中国大模型创业者。\n\n在大模型领域，传统的组织人才方式不work。\n\n真正的天才想法很难被媒体和大众所认知。\n\n预训练很重要，是范式转变，具体到Transformer架构，其实没那么重要。\n\n(2023 年上半年）未来半年各大厂商将密集发模型，但热潮不可持续，拿不到正反馈的团队将很快退场，速生速死。\n\nAI 产品领域的创业是战国时代，不论个人开发者和大厂之间，还是大厂和大厂之间，进入到一个所有人在PK所有人的状态。\n\n研发投入 95% 是浪费，而且你不知道哪 95% 是浪费的。一流 researcher 能节约 80% 的成本，但大部分组织没能力知道谁是一流的 researcher。\n\n\n在秘塔刚成立的 2018 年，闵可锐就写过一篇文章，叫《关于机器学习的前尘往事》（见 shownotes “相关链接”部分），这篇文章已经提到了当时 Anthropic 创始人，Dario 在百度工作期间，发现的 Scaling Laws 的雏形。这篇文章开头，是模仿《百年孤独》经典开篇的一个 AI 小故事。其中提到了 108 期节目中，马毅老师也聊到的 50 年代 AI 热潮中的“感知机”。\n\n\n闵可锐是马老师在伊利诺伊大学任职时的博士研究生，后肄业创业。此前他获得了复旦计算机学士学位，和牛津大学数学硕士学位。\n\n这期节目，我们完整聊了可锐的职业经历、秘塔创业故事、他在 2023 年年初对大模型格局的思考。而今天发的另一期节目，是最近秘塔发布新产品“今天学点啥”之后的访谈，我们从这个产品切入，聊了这两年的变化。\n\n本期嘉宾：\n闵可锐，秘塔科技创始人，@「AI秘塔」公众号 ID：METASOTA2018\n\n时间线跳转：\n00:05 开场介绍\n\n-预训练的想法很重要，而非具体架构\n02:20 秘塔的重心在应用；竞赛→复旦→牛津→伊利诺伊→第一次创业→猎豹→创立秘塔的简要回顾\n05:48 2017 年前后的真正技术转折是：预训练想法的出现\n12:36 2018 年，预训练到来后的创业选择：在特定领域做出价值→法律翻译\n12:14 OpenAI 难以效法；ChatGPT 之前，行业没有技术秘密\n14:41 GPT-3 刚出来时，参数规模大到短期内难以应用；没必要神话某一个架构\n22:14 一些 idea 的引用次数很高，但不是真正天才的想法\n25:25 Ilya 的成就：不是视觉背景的人做出了 NLP 突破，而是深度学习的不同领域在合流，AI 本身的泛化性在提升\n\n- 创业两条路：大故事、很多钱 vs 服务好能服务的用户\n27:17 Jasper 的贡献：找到一个机器贵、但人更贵的切入口\n30:58 从法律翻译到秘塔写作猫，垂直领域到更泛 C 的转变如何发生\n36:16 AI to C、to B，商业模式切身体验\n40:42 “创业公司的差异化是什么？”——要“做着瞧”\n45:56 AI 应用是战国时代，是所有人和所有人的 PK\n47:43 AI Native 应用的突破很可能在交互上\n52:16 秘塔也在自己训练模型，应用为重心的情况下，怎么做模型？\n01:01:28 开源模型的影响\n\n- “坦白来讲，大模型热潮也不是什么好事”\n01:08:02 AI 热潮对秘塔发展节奏的影响\n01:11:15 中国投资机构会集体 miss 模型层投资；开源是另一股力量\n01:16:13 中国有雄心更大的人，但还没有进入人们的视野\n01:19:14 这次热潮对比 2016 年 AlphaGo 之后的 AI 热，有何不同？\n01:24:11 秘塔当时的新融资推进：战投比较积极，财投很谨慎\n01:27:19 两种 AI 研究机构：手作坊 vs 工业化\n01:33:24 95% 的研发投入是浪费的，而且不知道浪费在哪儿；OpenAI 的成功经验是找到会花钱的少数研究者，让他们花很多钱\n01:37:14 短期 vs 长期，当前应用 vs 追求 AGI——“你以为的平衡，实际上是平衡不了”\n01:44:13 AI 热潮给算力成本带来的变化\n01:51:27 市场存在大的资源错配\n\n相关链接：\n关于机器学习的前尘往事（闵可锐）\n晚点聊110：与明势夏令聊Agent竞争：通用入口之战就要来，创业要做垂、做专\n晚点聊107：与真格戴雨森长聊 Agent：各行业都会遭遇“李世石时刻”，Attention is not all you need\n\n附录\n\n\nBERT（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）：Google  于 2018 年提出的一种预训练语言模型，首次引入双向 Transformer 编码器来理解上下文，显著提升了多个自然语言处理（NLP）任务的表现。\n\nT5（Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer）：Google Research 2019 年提出，它将所有 NLP 任务统一建模为文本到文本的转换问题。\n\nVision Transformer (ViT)：Google Research 2020 年提出，它是首个成功将纯Transformer 架构应用于图像分类任务的模型，将图像分割为小块并视为序列输入 Transformer。\n\n\n剪辑制作：甜食\n\n本期主播：小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "「你得相信，最坏的事情会发生。」\n\n今天我们一次发了两期节目，嘉宾都是秘塔创始人，闵可锐。\n\n113 期，是我和可锐在 2023 年年初的一次访谈，那次大模型热潮初期的漫谈中，有不少此后被印证的预言。本期，是 2025 年 4 月底，秘塔发布新产品“今天学点啥”之后，我和晚点科技组作者与桐，一起对闵可锐的访谈。\n\n我们从“今天学点啥”这个新产品切入，聊了秘塔探索新产品的方法、思路和执行，以及闵可锐对 AI 应用发展的思考。\n\n\n\n秘塔持续推出了一些有口碑和用户的 AI 产品，包括秘塔写作猫、秘塔搜索等。与之形成反差的是，在 2023 年的大模型热潮后，秘塔并没有加速扩张和融资，仅在 2024 年新融了 1 亿多人民币。整个公司的估值也是低得保守。\n\n可锐是一个直言、坦诚，甚至有些“我行我素”的创始人。我问他为什么不融更多钱？他说，他当不了一个演员，他也不知道，为什么一些在他看起来拙劣的故事，不少投资人会 buy in，这超出了他的“能力范围”。\n\n他说最初看到 DeepSeek 的人才组织方式，就觉得这样非常对。我问他为什么秘塔不是这么组织的，他说，因为“我们没钱”。\n\n一方面，可锐的一些观点似乎有些悲观，他会说：“我们摸着石头过河，大厂摸着我们过河”；任何有潜力主要依靠大模型能力达到 1000 万 DAU 的软件应用，大模型厂商和大公司一定会自己做。另一方面，他依然在持续经营秘塔这家已经成立 7 年的小 AI 公司，拒绝了去年的一些收购机会。\n\n这是一期小 AI 公司创始人的生存之道，也是一个“没有偶像包袱”的 AI 从业者的一手观察。\n\n本期嘉宾：\n闵可锐，秘塔科技创始人，@「AI秘塔」公众号 ID：METASOTA2018\n\n时间线跳转：\n- 今天学点啥\n03:05 今天学点啥：黑神话冯骥自来水，闵可锐自己打 70 分；马上会推出新优化\n09:09 其实秘塔 80% 的产品决策是“我拍脑袋”的\n11:18 to C、to B AI 产品秘塔都做过，不同的决策方式\n18:14 “为什么没做 Agent 方向产品”——为什么做大家都在做的事？\n20:32 Manus 的很多效果得益于 Claude；25 年的模型来做通用 Agent，成功率仍是问题\n25:58 秘塔为何没沿着法律场景、做垂直 Agent？\n27:56 收入是产品决策的重要指标；过去 7 年多少名噪一时的 AI 公司，要么死了，要么大幅收缩\n29:45 我融不了很多钱；我讲真话大家也不信，也做不了演员\n\n- 再聊两年前的「预言」\n34:44 模型做不到全球 top 的 foundation model 创业公司挑战重重\n36:14 做基础模型就应该是 DeepSeek 的人才组织方式\n37:27 AI 战场都是聪明人，不要奢望兼顾 8 个产品、同时开几条模型线，还能在某个方向碾压别人\n38:11 AI 一定要算 ROI 吗？AGI 也可以是消费\n41:46 Llama4 再次证明，“一流资源、二流团队”打不过“二流资源、一流团队”；字节人才密度很高，关键是怎么发挥价值\n42:55 梁文锋最懂什么？\n\n- 模型和应用的边界\n44:56 to B、to C 应用，基础模型，我都可以做，不过没人相信\n49:48 法律翻译、秘塔搜索，都不适合出海，但“今天学点啥”之后会出海\n52:48 我们的对手会是 1 万亿的公司，你得相信，最坏的事情会发生\n54:30 因为保守错失了哪些机会？\n57:36 去年为什么拒绝被收购？\n01:01:21 谨慎与抛弃沉末成本，闵可锐的双面性\n01:03:28 Jasper 没死，但大家都要“踩一脚”\n01:05:06 所有主要依靠大模型有潜力到 1000 万 DAU 的软件应用，大（模型）公司都会自己做\n\n-模型技术讨论\n01:10:19 大模型和小模型结合，只是个很简单描述；整体思路是：1.服务自己的用户 2.及时跟进下一代模型解锁的能力\n01:16:46 o 和 R 真的在推理吗？智能的形式比本质更可验证\n01:23:58 用强化学习做推理模型之后，很多人低估了好的预训练的重要性\n01:25:42 Grok3 和 Llama4 是两件事，Grok3 成功证明了一个后出发的团队，能快速追赶一线能力\n01:29:55 Scaling Laws 不是线性外推，很可能到了新卡点，又会有新突破\n01:32:59 过去曾有哪些技术误判，导致错失机会？\n\n-过去两年，我各方面都更会了\n01:37:26 我们摸着石头过河，大厂摸着我们过河，创业公司得更快找到下一个石头\n01:38:43 一个足够灵敏的组织，理想 vs 现实\n01:41:03 目前秘塔的团队分工、协作\n01:45:52 为什么没找产品合伙人？\n01:49:33 热潮前后，秘塔团队节奏的变化\n01:55:25 23 年至今的变化：自己“更会了”，接下来希望能和整个组织一起成长\n\n相关链接：\n晚点聊108：与马毅聊智能史：DNA是最早的大模型，智能的本质是减熵\n晚点聊110：与明势夏令聊Agent竞争：通用入口之战就要来，创业要做垂、做专\n晚点聊107：与真格戴雨森长聊 Agent：各行业都会遭遇“李世石时刻”，Attention is not all you need\n\n剪辑制作：甜食\n\n*本期主播：\n*小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n**即刻 @王与桐\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "「伯克利 BAIR 博士、清华叉院助理教授，跳进具身创业。」\n\n高阳是清华大学交叉信息研究院的助理教授，同时也是具身智能公司千寻的联合创始人和首席科学家。\n\n高阳在具身智能领域深耕多年，他是清华计算机系本科，UC Berkeley 博士，师从国际计算机视觉大师 Trevor Darrell。在 2016 年时，他就和许华哲一起做了端到端自动驾驶的课题，这在当时是个小众的方向，但如今已经成为自动驾驶行业的共识。\n\n这几年在具身智能领域崭露头角的早期公司，多多少少有 UC Berkeley 学子的身影——刚才提到的许华哲是星海图的首席科学家，星动纪元的创始人陈建宇、最近刚刚加入估值最高的智元机器人的罗建兰，都曾在 UC Berkeley 深造过；创立边塞科技的吴翼也是毕业于 UC Berkeley。\n\n在 2024 年，高阳与有产业经历的韩峰涛共同创立了千寻，千寻在非共识中找到的切入点是端到端+具身大脑+机器人本体+互联网视频预训练、模仿学习、强化学习。成立至今，千寻已经获得了四轮融资。最近他们也发布了VLA Spirit v1 的 demo，机器人可以叠衣服了。\n\n这次我们不仅聊到了高阳的技术理解，也聊到了他的思维方式和过往经历。\n\n创业者们都在尝试怎么把机器人做得更像人，而高阳像一个融入人类世界的机器人：他从不熬夜，早晨七点半“开机”，每天骑 31-33 分钟的共享单车前往工作地点，在每周固定时间健身；他相信 COT（Chain-of-Thought，思维链），认为所有事情都可以按照 COT 一步一步走向结果，不仅是生活，也包括学术研究和创业，甚至“一步一步，每一个链条都做好，自然会导向具身智能的 L2、L3 的实现”。\n\n这位 91 年出生的具身研究者和创业者，不倾向输出斩钉截铁的结论，但他相信他推理出的一切，不管和别人的声音是否一致。\n\n本期嘉宾：\n高阳，千寻智能首席科学家，清华叉院助理教授，个人主页（内有邮箱联系方式）\n\n时间线跳转：\n\n-“中国速度”在具身智能的体现：修机器\n02:02 创业 moment：科学家能做的探索越来越少，这在大语言模型领域已经发生\n04:09 团队搭建：产业老炮+年轻科学家\n07:18 Figure 02 的 demo 很好，展示了快慢系统\n09:38 中国相对美国优势在于修机器人快，不然修机器人的速度赶不上做实验的速度\n12:12 具身智能的阶段划分\n14:23 现在中国具身智能在从 L1 到 L2 的路上\n\n-机器人必须得是“人”形吗？\n14:41 机器人不一定是人形，但 L2 以后可能需要双臂+轮式底盘\n15:31 没有操作、只有移动，不能解决主要矛盾\n18:52 双足不难，没有本质的卡点\n21:31 虽然操作重要，但一定得有上半身吗？其实是从成本角度考虑的，像“人”一定可行\n23:53 人形机器人，到底是更精细分工，还是更泛化？\n\n-“端到端是走向具身智能的共识，分层只是短期工程选择”\n27:00 端到端（VLA，Vision-Language-Action）是现在具身智能的共识吗？\n28:53 训练过程：互联网视频预训练、模仿学习、强化学习\n29:51 为什么叠衣服这样的操作会成为具身智能领域的“智商测试”？\n34:14 快慢系统在叠衣服这件事里怎么配合的？\n35:35 当前机器人的主要挑战是泛化性\n\n-“人是分布式，机器人是中心式”\n36:28 视频数据的可用量只有 1%，机器人学习怎么操作、预测轨迹\n38:44 人类的肌肉记忆，机器人也有\n43:33 跨任务泛化：强化学习成功率取决于基模的训练和 SFT（监督微调 Supervised Fine-Tun-ing）\n45:00 具身智能也有 Scaling Laws 吗？做到 GPT3.5，可能需要 100 亿条有效数据、1 亿遥操数据、几千万强化学习数据\n49:05 Scaling Laws 在仿真数据不成立\n\n-“具身智能做到 GPT-4 那种程度还得5年”\n50:32 为什么只做大脑不行？驯化新的躯体很难的\n51:55 为什么只做本体不行？价值在大脑端，现在有了大脑能力才引起的风潮\n53:06 机器人未来会像汽车产业链\n55:10 关于朱啸虎说的没有商业化，高阳觉得现在最重要的还是把技术做好\n56:41 行业何时收敛？当具身智能走向 L2 时\n57:57 现在具身智能的瓶颈还是在 AI，要补齐才能成为“木盆”\n\n-个人成长：一位信奉 COT 的“小天才”\n59:35 伯克利“归国几子”的介绍\n01:01:27 同一个实验室的，还有许华哲、贾扬清等\n01:03:22  2016 年博士最开始做自动驾驶，那时端到端自动驾驶还不被相信\n01:06:41 学术不需要灵光乍现，个人的思考方式就是 COT\n01:07:11 所以在明年 6 月具身智能会到 L2，再过一年半到两年 L3\n01:07:34 读书时在 waymo 实习三个月：感觉脑子要坏掉了\n01:10:15 读博想创业，但没好机会；毕业后回国做科研，伯克利“归国几子”兼职“HR”\n01:12:43 跟许华哲最近讨论：看起来具身智能是个非共识行业，但这已经是坍缩、收敛后的结果\n01:15:54 大学教授出来创业，会拍拍屁股走人吗？\n01:17:37 一个崇尚规律的 ISTJ：不熬夜、骑共享单车上下班、规律健身\n\n相关链接：\n晚点聊 86：We,Robot-2，清华叉院/星海图许华哲看“Optimus”的门道\n晚点聊 65：信仰充值的威力，与逐际谌华聊 GTC 和人形机器人新进展\n晚点聊 40：与梅卡邵天兰聊通用机器人，AI 的下一个浪潮？\n\n剪辑制作：甜食\n\n本期主播：即刻 @王与桐\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "在全球贸易格局持续变化的背景下，中美贸易关系正经历新一轮深刻调整。自特朗普上任以来，美国针对中国商品的关税政策频繁变化：从 2 月初取消 800 美元以下小包免税，到 4 月初对华加征 34% 对等关税，再到一周后累计关税上调至 145%。\n这一系列变化，不仅考验着中国供应链与跨境销售体系的稳定性，也对中小卖家、平台运营与资本市场带来连锁冲击。\n面对层层加码的成本压力，中国跨境卖家该如何应对？关税变化是危机，还是品牌转型的窗口？本期节目，我们邀请资深跨境电商从业者 Bennett，以及投资人周玖洲（Aaron），一起拆解关税变化背后的行业逻辑与应对策略。\n在不确定中寻找确定性，这场关税风暴，也许正是中国跨境电商行业全球化升级的重要转折点。\n\n本期人物\n丁教 Diane，「声动活泼」联合创始人、「科技早知道」主播\n周玖洲 Aaron， 十年中金、华夏基金等顶级投资机构工作经验，「不止金钱」主播\nBennett大雄，圳鲸跨境创始人\n\n主要话题\n03:42 关税政策反复调整，卖家信心为何未被击垮？\n06:19 危机之下，工厂型卖家、贸易型卖家困境各不相同\n10:07 从美国转向欧洲：跨境卖家的成本对冲策略？\n15:10 美国仍是出海最大市场，积极应对而非盲目悲观\n16:30 优化货物体积、合理申报关税，卖家可将关税成本降低 50%\n26:56 品牌商与自建站卖家，在风暴中更具韧性\n32:31 T86 政策取消冲击低价平台，中小卖家将经历一轮洗牌与转型\n36:05 高关税政策为何注定不可持续？\n41:45 全球布局产业链：头部卖家早已将工厂开到了东南亚和拉美\n52:32 关税对价格的影响尚未显现，但高成本终将被消费者承担\n55:43 关税战：多输格局下的卖家自救路径\n01:02:56 新入场者指南：先布局多地，再评估美国市场\n\n延伸信息\n双清包税\n一种跨境物流服务模式，物流商同时承担出口国（中国）和进口国（美国）的清关手续与关税缴纳，卖家无需自行处理税务问题。\n全托管 \n平台完全掌控定价权与运营权，卖家仅作为供应商供货，不参与销售策略制定。全托管模式下，平台对低价商品有绝对控制权，但关税成本直接转嫁卖家\n半托管 \n卖家与平台共享运营权，卖家可自主调整售价、营销策略，平台提供物流等基础设施支持。半托管模式赋予卖家定价灵活性，以对冲关税压力。\n货柜电商（Marketplace E-commerce） \n以商品货架陈列为核心的传统电商模式（如亚马逊、沃尔玛），依赖用户主动搜索，流量分配取决于广告竞价与转化率。\nDTC （Direct-to-Consumer）\n品牌通过独立站或私域渠道直接触达消费者，绕过中间商，强调品牌故事、用户复购与数据沉淀。DTC 模式可通过品牌溢价对冲成本，且不受平台流量绑架。\n\n幕后制作\n监制：Yaxian\n后期：Jack\n运营：George \n设计：饭团\n\n内容研究志愿者招募\nHi 你好呀，这里是「科技早知道」内容研究志愿者招募。如果你是前沿科技行业的从业者（包括但不限于半导体、先进制造、计算机、AI、生物医药、航空航天等等），欢迎加入我们分享你在行业内的一手观察和见解。\n你将有机会参与到节目的制作当中，你的知识和见解也可能成为未来节目的一部分！\n志愿者招募入口 \n\n加入声动活泼\n声动活泼目前开放全职设计师、商业发展经理、商业内容策划、内容编辑实习生、早咖啡内容研究实习生、社群运营实习生等6个职位，详情点击招聘入口\n\n\n声动活泼年度新节目上线！\n这次，我们倾全团队之力为 AI 时代的青少年做了一件微小但重要的事。\n\n每期 10 分钟，从一个青少年感兴趣的现象谈起，涉及商业科技、社会人文等话题，解读表象背后的深层逻辑，启发青少年提出自己的好奇。每周一、三、五早晨 6 点在各大音频平台准时更新。\n\n🧧前 3 期内容可以免费试听。现在购买，即可享受早鸟价 292 元，2025 年 4 月 30 日之后，将恢复原价 365 元。现在就去节目主页试听吧 ↓\n小宇宙听友请点这里\nApple Podcast 听友请点这里\n\n商务合作\n声动活泼商务合作咨询\n\n\n关于声动活泼\n「用声音碰撞世界」，声动活泼致力于为人们提供源源不断的思考养料。\n我们还有这些播客：声动早咖啡、声东击西、吃喝玩乐了不起、反潮流俱乐部、泡腾 VC、商业WHY酱、跳进兔子洞 、不止金钱\n欢迎在即刻、微博等社交媒体上与我们互动，搜索 声动活泼 即可找到我们。\n期待你给我们写邮件，邮箱地址是：ting@sheng.fm\n\n欢迎扫码添加声小音，在节目之外和我们保持联系。\nSpecial Guests: Aaron and Bennett大雄.",

    "description": "The web will be far worse off if Google is forced to sell Chrome, even if it's to atone for legitimate ad-market monopoly abuses. Which mean we'll all be worse off as the web would lose ground to actual monopoly platforms, like the iOS App Store and Google's own Play Store. \nFirst, Chrome won the browser war fair and square by building a better surfboard for the internet. This wasn't some opportune acquisition. This was the result of grand investments, great technical prowess, and markets doing what they're supposed to do: rewarding the best. Besides, we have a million alternatives. Firefox still exists, so does Safari,  so does the billion Chromium-based browsers like Brave and Edge. And we finally even have new engines on the way with the Ladybird browser. \n\nLook, Google's trillion-dollar business depends on a thriving web that can be searched by Google.com, that can be plastered in AdSense, and that now can feed the wisdom of AI. Thus, Google's incredible work to further the web isn't an act of charity, it's of economic self-interest, and that's why it works. Capitalism doesn't run on benevolence, but incentives.\n\nWe want an 800-pound gorilla in the web's corner! Because Apple would love nothing better (despite the admirable work to keep up with Chrome by Team Safari) to see the web's capacity as an application platform diminished. As would every other owner of a proprietary application platform. Microsoft fought the web tooth and nail back in the 90s because they knew that a free, open application platform would undermine lock-in — and it did!\n\nBut the vitality of that free and open application platform depends on constant development. If the web stagnates, other platforms will gain. But with Team Chrome pushing the web forward in a million ways — be it import maps, nested CSS, web push, etc. — is therefore essential.\n\nThis is a classic wealth vs. riches mistake. Lawyers see Chrome as valuable in a moment's snapshot, but the value is all in the wealth that continued investment brings. A Chrome left to languish with half the investment will evaporate as quickly as a lottery winner's riches. Wealth requires maintenance to endure.\n\nGoogle should not get away with rigging the online ad market, but forcing it to sell Chrome will do great damage to the web.",

    "description": "【本期内容】\n\n现在，MCP 俨然要成为 AI 领域调用外部数据和工具的通用协议。MCP（即模型上下文协议）由 Anthropic 在 2024 年 11 月开源，旨在帮助 AI 助手连接外部工具和数据，提升灵活性和上下文感知能力。\n\n为什么这个去年发布的协议，突然在今年火了？Anthropic、OpenAI、谷歌三大顶牛模型厂均表示支持，MCP 的「魅力」在哪？它又将给 AI 创业带来哪些机会？\n\n本期播客，我们邀请到了最一线的创业者和开发者，一起拆解 MCP 以及它的现在和未来。\n\n                                                                     \n\n【嘉宾】\n\n靖宇｜极客公园副主编\n\n宛辰｜极客公园作者\n\n陈霈霖｜vika 维格云 创始人 & CEO\n\nidoubi｜ThinkAny & MCP.so 创始人\n\n                                                                            \n\n【精彩时刻】\n\n04:00 MCP 协议是什么？在解决什么问题？优势在哪？\n\n09:38 API 是电源线，MCP 是插头，两者并非替代关系\n\n12:16 Function Calling 是怎么实现工具调用的？和 MCP 的区别在哪？\n\n16:13 去年 11 月推出的 MCP，为什么今年突然火了？\n\n18:12 大家纷纷选择拥抱 Anthropic 的 MCP 协议，为什么？跟先发优势有关吗？\n\n21:51 MCP 协议对 AI 创业产生了什么影响？有哪些新机会？\n\n29:21 有了 MCP，哪个 AI 应用里实现任务的完成度高，取决于什么？\n\n31:43 Anthropic 为什么选择做 MCP 这样的开源协议？给他的生态带来了什么好处？\n\n33:28 国内会有自己的 MCP 协议吗？\n\n34:14 MCP 的局限在哪？\n\n35:42 拆解 Anthropic 的战略布局\n\n                                                                            \n\n【名词释义】\n\n  \nFunction Calling ：大模型（如 GPT-4、Qwen 等）的扩展机制，使模型能够根据用户请求生成函数调用的指令（如函数名称、参数），开发者再通过程序执行这些指令并返回结果。\n  \nAPI：一组预定义的函数、协议和工具集合，其核心作用是解耦系统间的依赖关系。开发者无需关注功能的具体实现（如操作系统如何读取文件、数据库如何存储数据），只需通过接口调用即可完成操作。例如，地图 API 可让应用直接调用定位功能，而无需自行开发地理信息系统。\n  \nHTTP 协议：超文本传输协议（HyperText Transfer Protocol）的简称，是互联网中最基础且应用最广泛的应用层协议，主要用于规范客户端（如浏览器）与服务器之间的通信方式，实现超文本（如网页、图片等）的传输与交互。\n  \nRAG：检索增强生成（Retrieval-augmented Generation）的简称， 是一种结合信息检索与文本生成的技术，通过实时从外部知识库中检索相关上下文输入大语言模型（LLM），增强其生成内容的准确性和可解释性。其核心价值在于突破 LLM 的静态知识限制，动态引用最新数据、减少幻觉风险，并支持垂直领域定制化应用。\n  \nTool Use：人工智能领域中一种扩展大语言模型（LLM）能力边界的设计模式，通过让 AI 动态调用外部工具或 API，使其突破自身预训练知识的限制，完成实时数据获取、复杂计算、系统交互等任务。\n\n\n                                                                           \n\n【重要通知】\n\n🎉由极客公园全新打造的科技行业漫谈播客「逐渐离普」上线啦！\n\n😎极客公园离普编辑部小伙伴集体出道！接下来每周，编辑部的小伙伴将和大家一起，在这档播客中回顾当周最热的科技事件，为你蒸馏认知、聊透行业真相～\n\n😝没那么严肃，我们也偶尔吐槽和八卦！\n\n👏欢迎大家收听关注、踊跃报题、积极吐槽，一同加入「逐渐离普」的漫谈日常！\n\n划重点，我们是周更哦～节目指路👉逐渐离普\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n\n【关于节目】\n\n「开始连接 LinkStart」是一档由极客公园出品的科技商业播客。在这里，我们会邀请各行各业的嘉宾一起跨界对话、碰撞思想，用科技、商业和人文的视角一起描摹这个时代。\n\n欢迎同步关注「公众号/视频号-极客公园」，第一时间，带你追踪科技热点。\n\n本期编辑：雨倩\n\n剪辑：Katherine\n\n运营：雨倩\n\n监制：靖宇、xuxu\n\n公众号/视频号：极客公园",

    "description": "✒️欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活。我是雨白。\n\n最近几期，有听友在评论区问我们：小酒馆怎么开始聊起一些「形而上」的选题了？说实话，一方面是巧合；但另一方面，其实也不是我们故意「高深莫测」，而是我们越来越觉得，当这个世界处在巨大的动荡和转型期，真正影响资产价格的，不只是每天市场上的涨涨跌跌，而是人们内心相信的那个「大故事」。\n\n这也是为什么，今天这期节目的关键词是：叙事。\n\n本期节目，我们请来了金融圈里最会讲故事的学者之一——香帅老师。这也是她人生中第一次走进播客录音间。她聊得非常放松，甚至有点过于松弛，有些观点乍一听可能有点「刺耳」，但我相信，你一定能听懂她想传达的真正想法。\n\n在她看来，2025年将是一个「叙事之年」。这期节目里，她结合自己这几年在全球走访调研的经历，和我们分享了很多真知灼见，比如：AI 领域正在冒出的新叙事是哪些？又有哪些旧叙事正在慢慢被淘汰？哪些只是昙花一现，哪些可能长久改变我们的未来？而在这些“故事的更替”中，我们普通人又有没有机会参与、甚至受益？\n\n如果听完之后你还有什么想听香帅老师聊的，欢迎在评论区留言。说不定，下次她就回来继续聊聊！\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n香帅：经济学者，曾任北京大学金融学副教授 、博士生导师，香帅数字经济研究中心创始人，“香帅的金融江湖”自媒体创始人、得到《香帅的北大金融学课》主理人。著有书籍：《金钱永不眠Ⅰ》《金钱永不眠Ⅱ》《香帅金融学讲义》《钱从哪里来》系列6册\n\n🚁 时间轴\n\n01:43 据说，智人之所以能够战胜尼安德特人，是因为我们会讲故事\n\n06:41 新技术刚刚兴起的时期，往往是叙事纷杂涌现的时期\n\n07:25  历史总会押韵，但韵脚有所不同\n\n12:03 任何一个社会在解构的过程中，都会有新的职业与机会出现\n\n17:48 别把问题停留在脑中：去尝试，此路不通，咱就走下一条路\n\n21:52  在叙事涌现的年代，我们需要拥有辨别真假的能力\n\n33:15 从马云到雷军：中国消费市场的价值观叙事变迁\n\n37:52 「后物质价值观」：消费不再只用来满足刚需，而是成为一个人塑造自我的方式\n\n42:44 消费分级：大共识没有了，但还有很多细分领域里的微需求\n\n58:34 年轻的时候，可以试着去拥抱一点点高风险资产，以身投入未来趋势之中\n\n64:46 「 如果每个人的人生都是一本书，那我的人生叙事大概是金庸体」\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🧰 家庭财务工具箱\n\n为未来设定清晰目标，随不同的阶段调整步伐，如实记录当下——这样的规划，或许正是我们掌控生活的开始。\n\n我们 有知有行 App 的有行模块，已经逐步升级成为了你的家庭财务工具箱。这套工具箱可以帮助你更直观地记录和看见自己有多少钱，你的家庭资产是如何分布的，分配得是否合理，以及你是否有把家庭资产暴露在了不必要的风险之中。\n\n如果你是新用户，我们尤其推荐你从家庭资产记账开始，也许你会发现自己比想象中的更有钱。\n\n升级 有知有行 App 到最新版本，就可以体验到了，去试试看，希望你会喜欢。\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 香帅｜主持 雨白｜后期 明睿｜制作 雨烨 星星 ｜单集封面\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "description": "日本，是中国一衣带水的邻国，近代以来给中国既带来现代新风，也带来深重的苦难。中国和日本，常常被当作东亚儒家文明现代化转型的两个极端：一个是大国，转型步履蹒跚，一直在传统与现代之间徘徊；一个是小国，转型迅速彻底，但很快走上扩张侵略的道路。\n\n我们对于明治维新之后的日本历史似乎很熟悉，殖产兴业、废藩置县、文明开化、富国强兵，伺候就主要聚焦于朝鲜和中国，开始了扩张的进程。但是我们对近代日本的精神思想了解甚少，无论是明治维新、大正民主，还是作为近代日本对立面的德川幕府体制，仿佛日本一夜之间从东方文化全面转向西方文化，没有任何精神内核。\n\n那么作为日本近代转型基础的德川时代日本精神世界是什么样子的？忠君与暴虐一体两面的武士道精神，樱花绚烂过后四处飘零的物哀审美，空寂简洁的禅宗……这些在中国都能找到原型的思想资源，在日本如何成长为我们陌生的形态？本期节目，我们邀请到华东师范大学的李永晶老师，带我们一起纵览日本近代思想。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n主播：何必（北京大学历史学博士）\n\n嘉宾：李永晶（华东师范大学政治学系副教授）\n\n【收听指南】\n\n02:23 许多人对日本都会有一种复合的情感\n\n06:49 自以为很熟悉，有时反而容易误解\n\n09:29 江户儒学的载体是武士，而非文人士大夫\n\n16:00 德川幕府创立之初，被立为官学的朱子学\n\n22:01 明清鼎革，朱舜水东渡，中国儒学“日本化”\n\n27:29 阳明学，在近代日本起到了更重要的作用\n\n33:27 从“心即理”“致良知”到武士道精神的二重性\n\n38:40 幕末的“尊王攘夷”思想，反而埋葬了幕府\n\n43:53 德川家康利用了儒家，也利用了佛教制度\n\n48:22 德川体制下，寺庙是管理民众的国家机构\n\n53:24 禅宗在日本的艺术形式，直接体现了思想\n\n01:00:07 日本佛教经过了数层文明的筛选和过滤\n\n01:06:33 神道教，何种意义上是日本的本土思想？\n\n01:11:28 日本神道与天皇有关，与日常生活有关\n\n01:16:07 神道教与佛教的“分工”：多元共存共生\n\n01:20:49 “翻篇儿主义”，对真正的文明敞开胸怀\n\n【工具箱】\n\n01 李永晶，华东师范大学政治学系政治哲学与思想史专业副教授；东京大学博士。著有《分身：新日本论》《变异：日本二千年》《大欢喜：论语章句评唱》《老子智慧八十一讲》等。\n\n02 江户幕府（日语：えどばくふ；1603年3月24日-1868年4月21日），又称德川幕府。是日本历史上最后一个武家统治幕府。1603年德川家康在江户（今东京）开设幕府，至1868年江户开城，江户幕府共经十五代征夷大将军，历时265年。\n\n03 日本朱子学派，日本江户时代信奉朱熹学说的儒学家集团。朱熹学说在镰仓幕府时代传入日本，此后280年间始终未成为独立的学术流派。16世纪后期藤原惺窝否定佛教的优越性，脱僧还俗专讲儒学，成为日本朱子学的创始人。在其影响和教育下，出现一批朱子学者，其高足林罗山全面发展日本朱子学，按幕藩体制的要求建设儒学，并将藤原惺窝尚带宗教色彩、停留在“修身齐家” 水平上的朱子学，提到“治国平天下”的高度，从而确立朱子学的统治地位。\n\n04 水户学是江户时代的重要思潮之一，因形成于水户藩而得名。以水户藩第二代藩主德川光国主持编修的《大日本史》，成为水户学形成的起点。水户学有前期水户学和后期水户学之分。前期水户学派以修史为中心；后期水户学以水户藩第九代藩主德川齐昭的弘道馆为中心，向政教学方向发展。后期水户学为幕末时期的尊王攘夷运动提供了思想基础。\n\n05 阳明学，又称王学、心学，作为儒学的一门学派，最早可推溯自孟子，是由王守仁发展的儒家学说。阳明学在日本的真正兴盛是在江户末期，主要的代表人物有佐藤一斋和大盐中斋。佐藤一斋师事大阪朱子学派的中井竹山，后被任命为幕府儒官，他使阳明学由民间、蕃学一跃成为幕府之学。大盐中斋年少时曾赴江户学习儒学、武学，后回大阪任“与力”一职。三十八岁辞官后，在家塾洗心洞从事阳明学的讲授和著述。继之者又有吉田松阴等，将阳明学之精神在事功方面发挥到极致。\n\n06 神道教简称神道（Shinto），是日本大和民族和琉球族的宗教，分为大和神道和琉球神道。神道最初以自然崇拜、祖先崇拜、天皇崇拜等为主，属于泛灵多神信仰（精灵崇拜），视自然界各种动植物为神祇，也赋予各代日本天皇神性。神道教信仰多神，号称有80万神、800万神或1500万神，特别崇拜作为太阳神的皇祖神——天照大神。称日本民族是“天孙民族”，天皇是天照大神的后裔并且是其在人间的代表，皇统就是神统。祭祀的地方称神社或神宫，神职人员称为祠官、祠掌等。\n\n07 《古事记》和《日本书纪》均成书于日本奈良时代，当时还没有平假名和片假名，所以两部书都是由汉字写成的，但读者对象却不同。《古事记》全书分为上中下三卷，是在公元712年由太安万侶将稗田阿礼的口述内容汇编整理成册，献给了元明天皇，书中记载的故事以日本神话为主，面向国内读者。《日本书纪》在公元720年由舎人親王等人负责编辑完成，全书共30卷，内容主要记载了从上古众神时代到持统天皇时代的编年体历史事件，面向国外读者。\n\n08 本期提到的两部日本电影：《切腹》（1962）、《你的名字》（2016）\n\n【相关往期】\n\nVol.51丨列国志：日本，与中国的命运纠缠\n\nVol.161｜东京citywalk：博物馆中的美学、政治与人文艺术\n\nVol.162｜近代日本风云，聊聊天皇、元老、武士道｜嘉宾：商兆琦\n\nVol.205｜放“空”：佛学教会我们过一种真正自由的生活｜嘉宾：许小亮\n\nVol.218｜《完美的日子》：东京历史/文化/消费面面观｜嘉宾：Jam\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台关注我们。欢迎多多留言评论，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：media@eidos.wiki",

    "description": "ChatGPT 看着风骚，出圈不断，但最近 Gemini 2.5 Pro 口碑反杀，像个闷声干活的技术宅。这期就来扒一扒：为啥说谷歌这套“不性感但耐用”的打法，可能才是真牛逼？还有，为啥我们觉得 AI 下半场，最终还得看谷歌、腾讯这些“包租公”谁的生态家底更厚？\n\n一、反杀靠2B｜Gemini 2.5 Pro 口碑反杀：到底做对了啥？\n\n00:08 Gemini 2.5 Pro 初体验——“不止香，都吃撑了”。\n\n01:02 口碑反转：从“嫌弃谷歌嫌弃的要命”到“现在打脸”，Gemini 2.5 Pro 如何一夜“真香”？\n\n02:01 技术宅 vs 产品经理：谷歌的发布偏技术化、工程化，UI 难用，体验反人类？\n\n03:16 真香警告：一旦理解 Gemini 的能力（推理、长文本、原生多模态），就会开启真香模式。\n\n19:16 To B 的野望：谷歌 Cloud 业务年增长30%，Gemini 的“硬核”能力是否主要为 To B 服务？\n\n23:03 全栈自研的底气：从芯片到应用再到云服务，谷歌的全栈投入是其成本和能力优势的关键。\n\n二、下半场靠推理｜想明白后，谷歌卷起来是真的卷\n\n10:31 底盘而非产品：Gemini 更像是谷歌 AI 能力的“底盘”，而非独立产品，旨在提升所有产品的“内力”。\n\n11:41 巨人转身的加速：谷歌内部迭代速度前所未有，“六个月以前的产品已经是上一代”。\n\n12:48 推理的窗户纸：DeepSeek 如何捅破了“推理”这层窗户纸，让行业方向更加明确？\n\n16:05 推理是钥匙：AI 下半场，解决实际问题需要推理能力，Agent 等概念都基于此。\n\n30:00 形象比喻：GPT 像“聪明的孩子”，灵光幽默；Google 像“稳重的高材生”，全科但可能不那么有趣。\n\n37:31 留住核心人才：谷歌成功留住 DeepMind CEO、谷歌云 CEO 等关键人物，并吸引人才回流。\n\n三、终局靠生态｜为啥说 AI 最后还得拼“家底”？\n\n40:03 终局之战：AI 的竞争最终是否会演变成生态的比拼？\n\n46:04 被颠覆的品类：AI 将如何重塑现有产品？例如，NotebookLM 可能让传统笔记应用消失。\n\n51:59 生产者工具 vs 消费级产品：目前 AI 更像是生产力工具，尚未出现真正的消费级 AI 应用。\n\n提到的文章：《From ‘catch up’ to ‘catch us’: How Google quietly took the lead in enterprise AI》\n\n提到的文章：《The Second Half》\n\n【关注主播】：\n\n📕小红书：叫我小苏就好啊\n\n📺B站：叫我小苏就好啊\n\n📱微信：Roisu117\n\n【关注频道】：\n\n📕小红书：人民公园说AI\n\n▶️油管：人民公园说AI\n\n🐦推特：人民公园说AI",

    "description": "这期内容可能是2025至今最精彩的一期对谈。\n\n嘉宾是 1996 年出生的谢扬——13 岁接触编程，18 岁开始创业，至今已是一位连续创业者，曾入选福布斯30 under 30。他所创立的身份云公司 Authing 已是中国 SaaS 身份赛道的头部公司。\n\n（谢扬办公室内摆满的奖状）\n\n2024年6月，谢扬秘密开启了一个大模型Agent的项目，并在10个月之后，也就是一周前，发布了这款新产品 Fellou。\n\nFellou 是全球首个Agentic Browser，即行动型浏览器，你可以理解为是一群 AI 组团在你的电脑上打工，且它们可以隐身在一个影子空间内，不影响你的操控权。从用户角度来说，一句话=整套操作，平均任务完成用时3.7分钟。\n\n这几天，多位知名的AI KOL 已纷纷开始讨论这款新产品。这是继 Manus 爆火之后，又一个来自中国团队整活儿的AI Agent 产品；但与 Manus 不同，Fellou 完全以另一种浏览器的形式重构了对 AI Agent 的想象，其中充分体现了谢扬过往的出色编程能力和产品天赋。\n\n在Fellou发布会的第二天，我邀请谢扬录制了这一期播客。这将是《商业漫谈》目前为止时长最长的播客。我们的访谈实际进行了近四个小时。这是一位非常有个性、技术含金量和有思考的创业者，我个人看好、并衷心地祝愿这个项目。因此想原汁原味地保存下这段珍贵的记录。\n\n这期访谈将分为三个部分：\n\n第一部分，围绕一个孤独少年的编程之路；\n\n第二部分，主要围绕谢扬的上一段创业，toB 项目 Authing 中的重要 learnings。\n\n第三部分，也就是全球首个「浏览器 Agent」—— Fellou 是如何横空出世的、如何理解这个产品。\n\n（Notice：在本期节目留言区留下评论，可获取 Fellou 邀请码哟）\n\n\n\n本期嘉宾：谢扬（Fellou、Authing 创始人兼CEO）\n\n\n\n本期Shownotes：\n\nPart 1. 孤独少年的编程&创业之路\n\n04:21 13 岁与编程结缘：年少孤独，电脑是我最好的朋友\n\n07:11 「人是一根会思考的芦苇」\n\n08:51 网站22.DM，让我认识了一群志同道合的网友\n\n09:03 喜羊羊是一只好羊还是坏羊？\n\n10:46 这个论坛改变了我——我的那群天才朋友\n\n11:28 我也是一个互联网之子，但不会像 Aron Swatz 那样去非法下载期刊\n\n12:42 张一鸣说「头条和抖音是他看世界的一个窗口」，我相信他是真心的\n\n12:56 长年练就的「直觉」：我也不知道我为什么知道，但我就是知道\n\n15:10 13岁后的大事不胜枚举：在百度贴吧造「核武器」、模拟动漫游戏的交互系统、做一款海绵宝宝的播放器\n\n16:48 海绵宝宝总是说，「我准备好了！」\n\n17:42 乐观是一种方法，悲观是一种态度\n\n18:22 痛恨应试教育：现在回想起高中三年我都想哭\n\n22:00 我给人生规划了三个阶段：1.成为一个成熟的创业者（✅）2.拍一部电影 3.改变教育\n\n23:44 学长把我「卖」了，一个月800元——这使我决心做生产力的创业\n\n25:00 社会上有许多不公平，生产力能够拉起不公平的底线\n\n27:27 创业者和生意人是不一样的\n\n27:57 获得腾讯的银创奖，「这些年所有压抑都被释放了」\n\n28:54 我不觉得自己是天才，我非常非常努力\n\n29:49 不到十万元的奖金，成为创业的第一桶金：「我要的是换来经验」\n\n35:39 毕业进入字节，Gap 一下\n\n39:35 有见过张一鸣吗？——「在厕所里见过」🤣\n\n40:00 2019 已是巨头林立，先挑一个能赚钱的垂类方向——开始创业！\n\nPart 2. 身份云创业 Authing：700+客户、扩张200+人，三代产品的日与夜\n\n40:40 身份云创业：假设企业是建筑和装潢，我就是那个造门的\n\n41:27 创业灵感从哪来？\n\n42:56 没有任何 toB 资源：第一单 8000 元，第二单5万，第三单 80 万\n\n46:03 我是一个慷慨的老板\n\n47:43 Authing 斩获700多家客户：LuluLlemon、大众、保时捷、宾利、招商银行、海底捞、知乎、长兴存储、蓝箭航天……从制造业、互联网到硬科技\n\n48:39 我是一个外来者，对所有同行形成了降维打击\n\n49:29 全球范围内的竞争对手Okta：80 亿美金收购 Auth 0\n\n49:41 被评为全球最具影响力的身份创业者之一，「我登上纳斯达克的屏幕了😐」\n\n50:05 我见到 Okta 创始人的第一句话：安永和Lululemon是我们的客户😐他脸色就变了！\n\n51:13 创业之前如何做赛道研究和竞对分析？\n\n54:37 2021 年SaaS 投资热后，赛道骤然变冷：「死了很多 SaaS 公司」\n\n56:01 25 岁学到这么一堂课，挺好的\n\n57:38 其实创业 day 1 就能养活自己，但这些年不断投入研发，迭代了三代产品\n\n59:40 从超级巨头客户身上学到些什么？\n\n01:00:31 21 年我头发掉得很快\n\n01:00:45 两年内将公司拉到盈亏平衡：我始终留着超过18个月的现金流\n\n01:03:09 谢扬没有人情味，这是我听过最多的评价——现在我好一些了\n\n01:05:06 我学着去构建人与人的关系——AI 改变了我\n\n01:07:37 办公室贴了一张纸：失败的管理者总是尝试告诉别人，自己是对的\n\n01:09:25 「所有美好事物都是人和人之间深度关系的产物」\n\n01:10:29 C端的飞轮可能只是一瞬间，B端的时间却很难压缩\n\n01:11:52 做 toB，先研究清楚行业的哲学\n\n01:13:30 有人劝我离开牌桌，我坚决反对，一定要留在牌桌上\n\n01:15:22 为什么不去做 Salesforce 这类钱更多的生意？「我讨厌人多的地方」\n\n01:16:47 快乐，就是我知道我能做到😊\n\n01:17:30 小红书给我推毛泽东、海绵宝宝和火影忍者——这几年我越来越喜欢这个故事\n\nPart 3. 完美的生产力创业：Fellou 横空出世\n\n01:19:22 原来我觉得人生特别无趣，现在我觉得人生特别有趣！\n\n01:19:47 Fellou 能装载我对生产力的所有设想，非常好，非常完美\n\n01:20:21 2023大模型浪潮如火如荼：我着急，但也没那么着急\n\n01:21:01 2024春节，闭关读论文，抓住三点方向：推理、Coding、Agent\n\n01:22:33 特斯拉的 FSD 带来了很大的灵感\n\n01:25:09 目前市面上的浏览器分三类：传统浏览器（如Chrome、Safari等）、对话浏览器（如豆包、Arc等）、检索增强型浏览器（如Comet）\n\n01:25:35 Fellou 开创了一类行动型浏览器（Agentic Browser）\n\n01:27:49 如何找到具体的创业方向？——6月份的一个下午，天气很好，躺在床上我突然想明白了浏览器这个事儿\n\n01:29:24 那时 Dia 都还没发布：这家公司能够扔掉包袱，了不起\n\n01:30:57 Dia 融了5000万美金，Fellou 需要多少？\n\n01:31:40 关于做不做基础模型，我也有过纠结\n\n01:34:53 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 的提示：长期主义 和 Cloud Artifacts\n\n01:35:24 Google 是 AI 的源头：我一直关注 Google AI Lab 的论文\n\n01:36:03 多年以来，人们都说要做一款颠覆型的浏览器，却都没能颠覆成功，为什么？\n\n01:39:46 我要突破：拆解，加Z轴——为 Agent 单立一维度\n\n01:40:13 Fellou 的四大核心能力：深度行动、主动智能、影子空间、智能体网络——我们来逐一理解\n\n01:46:39 哆啦A梦里，大雄把自己的影子剪下来，就成为了一个 Agent\n\n01:52:51 自己做的测试结果：超过了OpenAI、Anthropic 和 Manus\n\n01:54:39 团队才出生几天，你居然敢说你超越了 OpenAI 和 Anthropic？——「那你自己比较下试一试，现在一片好评」\n\n01:54:57 Deep Search 是我贡献的最重要的 user case\n\n01:57:46 Fellou 不需要你喂文档给它，它就是一个小跟班，你走哪，它跟哪，也学到哪\n\n01:59:54 任务完成时间比 Manus 快：在框架上做了优化\n\n02:00:41 护城河就是，脏活、苦活、累活中靠勤奋积累出来的宝贵技术资源\n\n02:01:37 搭建起满意的技术团队：「3-4个月才挖来一个人」\n\n02:03:17 我识人很厉害哦，我有强烈的直觉\n\n02:05:29 找到第一批先锋用户：如何挑选需求？\n\n02:06:25 Agent 的商业模式构想：广告、按量付费、按任务付费……\n\n02:08:18 开脑洞：Fellou 更可能是一个谷歌，还是一个微软？\n\n02:08:37 再造一个新时代的微软：让每个人的每台电脑都有一个数字伙伴\n\n02:08:52 有什么能力是没有浏览器做不到的？\n\n02:09:47 Fellou 目前的可视化能力最好？——如何评估知识工作的可视化需求？\n\n02:12:39 怕不怕大厂竞争？——「大厂做这件事的时间成本也很高，而且我会足够快」\n\n02:14:42 国内商业精神的不健康：字节有四个团队在抄 Manus ，这毫无意义\n\n02:16:15 谁最有可能 follow 浏览器 Agent 这件事？「夸克」\n\n02:16:39 谁最应该 follow 这件事？「字节」——那百度呢？「忘记了」\n\n02:17:07 进可攻、退可守，底线够大，上限无限？\n\n02:18:01 1 亿用户是一个小目标：这事不小，但美\n\n02:19:03 左手国内，右手出海\n\n02:19:50 Fellou 历时10个月，不够快，还没全速运转\n\n02:20:41 微软是何时突破1亿用户的——软件现象级，往往伴随着推动硬件升级\n\n02:22:42 取名Fellou：希望每个人都有数字伙伴\n\n02:23:28 羡慕Manus吗？——「有自己的节奏就好」\n\n02:24:28 Agent 会带来新的伦理问题：「未知的失业问题，不知道怎么解决」\n\n02:27:10 我想过，如果这家公司很赚钱，我把钱分给他们（失业的人）\n\n02:27:45 「我就是理想主义」\n\n加听友群👇\n\n有关主理人：卫诗婕，独立商业作者，曾任《极客公园》执行总编，早年任职于《人物》、GQ报道、字节跳动。代表作：《ofo的终场战事》、《罗永浩：薛定谔的理想主义》、《朱一旦的枯燥生活》、《中东社交十年风云：金矿、折戟、浪潮再起》、《下一站，沙特》等。作品曾获虎嗅2024年度作者、金字节奖年度新锐作者、网易非虚构文学奖年度作者、全球真实故事奖中文报道十佳。\n\n有关「商业漫谈」：这是一档关注科技、商业、人文的深度访谈节目，致力于记录时代的商业史。聚焦商业趋势、伦理、竞争、价值。\n\n「打捞时代碎片，文字对抗时间。」",

    "description": "We received over 2,200 applications for our just-closed junior programmer opening, and now we're going through all of them by hand and by human. No AI screening here. It's a lot of work, but we have a great team who take the work seriously, so in a few weeks, we'll be able to invite a group of finalists to the next phase.\n\n\nThis highlights the folly of thinking that what it'll take to land a job like this is some specific list of criteria, though. Yes, you have to present a baseline of relevant markers to even get into consideration, like a great cover letter that doesn't smell like AI slop, promising projects or work experience or educational background, etc. But to actually get the job, you have to be the best of the ones who've applied!\n\n\nIt sounds self-evident, maybe, but I see questions time and again about it, so it must not be. Almost every job opening is grading applicants on the curve of everyone who has applied. And the best candidate of the lot gets the job. You can't quantify what that looks like in advance.\n\n\nI'm excited to see who makes it to the final stage. I already hear early whispers that we got some exceptional applicants in this round. It would be great to help counter the narrative that this industry no longer needs juniors. That's simply retarded.\n\n\nHowever good AI gets, we're always going to need people who know the ins and outs of what the machine comes up with. Maybe not as many, maybe not in the same roles, but it's truly utopian thinking that mankind won't need people capable of vetting the work done by AI in five minutes.",

    "description": "「长期看，LLM 是 Agent 和人类之间交互的前端，后端则靠 RL 模型完成工作。」\n\n几乎所有主流 AI Agent 产品，都把大语言模型（LLM），或者它的多模态升级版当作“大脑”，靠一个或几个 LLM 编排工作、调用工具。\n\n但也有不同的路。这期节目的嘉宾，Pokee.ai 的创始人朱哲清（Bill），认为 LLM 只是 Agent 理解人类需求、向人类递交产出的“前端”，后端决策、完成任务则可以靠用强化学习方法训练的、不依赖自然语言的模型完成。\n\nBill 提到，把 LLM 当作大脑时，Agent 调用工具的能力有限。这是因为 LLM 使用工具时，需要先把工具描述、输入、输出等相关信息传入上下文，而 LLM 支持的上下文长度有限。把 Agent 的决策中枢换成另一个强化学习模型可以解决这个问题。\n\n本期节目中，Bill 还聊到优秀的通用 Agent 需要具备四个要素：实现任务比人快、无需人工干预、能读取信息也能写入信息、成本低。Agent 产品的壁垒不在技术，而在于和用户的工作流深度绑定。\n\n此外，我们还和 Bill 聊了他对通用 Agent 接下来竞争态势的判断，以及他在强化学习还并没有成为显学时，便相信强化学习潜力的原因。\n\nBill 本科开始便在海外留学，不熟悉、常用一些专业术语的中文表达。节目中高频提及的英文术语，可参考 Shownotes 文末附录。\n\n本期嘉宾：\nPokee.ai 创始人，前 Meta 应用强化学习负责人、工程经理朱哲清\n\n时间线：\n-创业前，花近十年研究、落地强化学习算法\n04:02 一边在斯坦福读博士，一边在 Meta 上班，每周工作 110 个小时\n07:20 拒绝 LLM 创业机会，留在强化学习主航道上\n10:17 刚开始研究强化学习的时候，强化学习还并不是显学\n16:52 DeepSeek R1 带火了强化学习，让投资人意识到强化学习重要性\n\n-强化学习做 Agent 的优势\n19:26 现有 LLM 写入能力较弱，调用工具数量有限\n23:51 长期看，LLM 可能只是模型和用户的交互层，Agent 之间沟通不一定用语言\n\n-如何设计一款 Agent 产品，服务专业用户\n31:02 保留用户控制节点，避免“自由落体”的失控感\n36:36 Pokee.ai 想服务专业用户，未来还要进入企业工作流\n43:46 一项子任务失败，不一定挡住 Pokee.ai 完成其他子任务\n45:33 抛开 browser-use，强化学习 Agent 完成一项任务只需要数十秒\n46:53 Pokee.ai 最初没用 MCP，团队自己设计更简单的协议\n48:47 目前主流做 Agent 的方法还是以 LLM 为核心\n50:00 优秀 Agent 的四要素：速度快、无需干预、能读能写、成本低\n\n-创业故事：从垂直 Agent 回归通用 Agent\n58:20 Pokee.ai 团队全职员工只有四人，成员主要来自 Meta\n59:30 早期产品：旅行规划助手 / Shopify 助手\n01:02:07 强化学习爆火后，回归创业初衷做通用 Agent \n01:07:33 Manus 出圈是意料之内\n01:09:54 Pokee.ai 发布产品不会用邀请码，单次任务成本是同类产品的 1/10\n01:10:59 技术不是 Agent 的护城河，重要的是和用户工作流绑定\n01:20:24 Pokee.ai 在做通用 Agent，但也能帮垂直 Agent 落地\n01:22:15 Agent 行业最后会存留三到五家公司，接下来是各个通用 Agent 差异化的时候\n01:26:03 判断技术潜力的好方法：Toy Example（玩具案例）\n\n附录：\nRL（Reinforcement Learning）：强化学习；\npolicy：策略，强化学习语境下指模型完成任务的方式；\nexploration：探索，强化学习语境下指探索可能完成任务的新路径；\nexploitation：利用，强化学习语境下指利用已知信息，选择最优的动作，和 exploration 相对；\nreward model：奖励模型，是强化学习算法的一部分，用于评价某个动作的好坏；\nground truth：真值，指训练强化学习模型时使用的标准答案；\nprosumer（professional consumer）：专业用户，本期节目语境下指用 Agent 产品完成工作需求的用户；\ncontext length：大模型的上下文长度；\nbrowser-use：使 AI 能够像人类一样浏览、操作网页的开源工具；\nMonte-Carlo Tree Search：一种基于随机模拟的搜索算法，用于在决策过程中评估不同选择的潜在结果，常用于需要策略规划的情境中；\nAPI：应用程序编程接口，是一组允许不同软件系统之间通信、交换数据的规则；\nSDK：软件开发工具包，旨在帮助开发者为特定平台或系统构建应用程序。\n\n剪辑制作：甜食\n\n本期主播：\n孙海宁（微信 @_HaydenSun）\n程曼祺 小红书 @曼祺_火柴Q，即刻 @曼祺_火柴Q\n\n\n\n\n☆《晚点聊 LateTalk》建立「 播客听友群」啦！☆\n\n欢迎关注科技、商业大公司动态和创业创新的小伙伴进群交流，第一时间收听新节目。\n这里有更多互动，更多话题讨论。欢迎贡献选题 & 推荐嘉宾。\n\n请先添加「晚点」小助手的微信号，备注：“晚点聊”，我们邀请您入群。\n\n\n\n关注公众号《晚点 LatePost》和《晚点对话》，阅读更多商业、科技文章：",

    "description": "🤖 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活，我是雨白。\n\n之前很多听众问我们，AI时代来了，小酒馆怎么不聊聊 AI？我说，我们不是不聊，而是在等合适的机会和嘉宾。这一次，终于等到了。\n\n今天做客小酒馆的重磅嘉宾，是微软中国的 CTO 韦青。认识韦青老师是在去年年底，在中信出版社组织的尤瓦尔·赫拉利的新书《智人之上》的分享会上，我是主持人，他是嘉宾。一开始我肤浅了，我以为他作为一个技术大拿，可能会从专业视角分享很多行业的洞察，但当他开口之后，我下巴都要惊掉了，韦老师旁征博引、博闻强识，简直就是一个行走的大模型，他对 AI 的观察和思考，很多都是我从未想过的角度，格外有启发性。\n\n让我耿耿于怀的是，当时那场分享会，只来了二十个人，太可惜了。这么好的内容，必须得让咱们小酒馆的听众听到。于是我软磨硬泡，花了四个月时间，从冬天到春天，总算请来了韦青老师。那时他刚刚从国外回来，结束了一场微软全球的培训。我们的对话也从这场培训开始。\n\n不过，与其说这是一场和韦青老师的谈话，我更愿意称其为一场宣言，对 AI 行业的从业者、对我们每一个使用者，每一个利益相关方都需要思考的问题的宣言——\n\n我们想要怎样的未来？\n\n相信我，接下来这一个多小时绝对值得你的时间。如果你听完之后，也能感受到和我当时同样的，智识上的兴奋与震撼，欢迎你把这期节目分享给更多的人。\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n韦青：微软（中国）有限公司首席技术官\n\n🚁 时间轴\n\n01:40  与 AI 热潮相伴而来的各种新名词：每当世界剧烈变化的时候，首先变的是话语体系\n\n07:08  人是一种比我们想象中更易受骗的生物 🫣\n\n15:48  技术制造者的职责：我们首先要告诉客户，这个东西表现出的所有行为，都是一种概率的计算结果，它不是人\n\n17:39  「机器是人的一面镜子，人也是机器的一面镜子」 🪞\n\n25:21  工程师们具备了打造「AI 白骨精」的能力，但大众消费者并不具备孙悟空的火眼金睛\n\n34:45  各领风骚几十天的技术行业：没有领导者与追随者，只有现任者与挑战者\n\n40:43  AI 会不会把我的工作取代？这是一个隐藏在真问题后面的假问题\n\n45:01  何为通往智慧的道路？犯错，犯错，再犯错：真正的错误（mistake）一定要避免，但偏差（error）是永恒的\n\n53:56 听话、苦干、不出错，这是机器的本分；而人类的作用是为世界提供异常值\n\n61:57  人工智能行业现在的问题是，我们没有写好说明书，就把它推给了大众\n\n65:21 像重视食品安全那样重视精神食粮：你不会随便捡起地上的面包喂进嘴里\n\n74:12  给普通人的三条 AI 智能时代生存锦囊 👛\n\n79:22 人工智能代替不了达利，也代替不了吉卜力：机器人们，别陷入仿真之中 🖼️\n\n🔍 猜你想看\n\n02:32 在2022年2月8日（此处嘉宾的「2023年」为口误），微软首席技术官凯文·斯科特（Kevin Scott）与科幻小说《雪崩》的作者尼尔·斯蒂芬森（Neal Stephenson）进行了一次深入对话，这次对话是微软播客节目 Behind the Tech with Kevin Scott 的其中一期。\n\n03:51 韦青：二零二五之「十要十不要」\n\n08:26 此处提及的是一种经典的视错觉现象，凹面错觉（Hollow-Face Illusion）\n\n16:05 Scott Hanselman ：微软的资深技术传道者（Technical Fellow），常以主讲人身份参与微软全球开发者活动，负责讲解Azure、.NET、开发者工具等前沿技术。\n\n24:47 KL散度（Kullback-Leibler divergence，简称KLD）：在消息系统中称为相对熵（relative entropy），在连续时间序列中称为随机性（randomness），在统计模型推断中称为消息增益（information gain）。也称消息散度（information divergence）。\n\n29:00 让·鲍德里亚（Jean Baudrillard）：法国社会学家及哲学家。美国导演沃卓斯基自称受鲍德里亚著作《拟像与仿真》的影响，而在 1999 年拍出《黑客帝国》第一部。\n\n43:57 此处引用的原文为：\n\nThe road to wisdom? — Well, it's plain and simple to express: Err and err and err again but less and less and less.\n\n这句话出自丹麦科学家、设计师、诗人皮特·海因（Piet Hein，1905–1996）的短诗系列《Grooks》，他活跃于科学、设计和文学领域，并与爱因斯坦等科学家有过交流。\n\n54:37 马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）：加拿大传播学家，以提出“媒介即讯息”（The medium is the message）和“地球村”（Global village）等概念而闻名，被誉为“媒介研究之父”。\n\n55:46 旅行者1号（Voyager 1）是美国国家航空航天局（NASA）研制的一艘无人外太阳系空间探测器，于1977年9月5日发射，是有史以来距离地球最远的人造飞行器，也是第一个离开太阳系的人造飞行器。\n\n65:41 万尼瓦尔·布什（Vannevar Bush）：美国工程师，发明家和科学行政人员。他尤其以模拟计算机和 Memex 而闻名。\n\n65:43 司马贺：本名为赫伯特·亚历山大·西蒙（Herbert Alexander Simon），美国学者、计算机科学家和心理学家，1975年图灵奖得主，1978年获诺贝尔经济学奖。\n\n69:28 Lex Fridman：俄裔美国人，麻省理工学院（MIT）研究科学家，知名的播客主持人。他因主持 Lex Fridman Podcast 而广为人知，该节目以深入访谈科技、哲学、政治等领域的杰出人物著称。\n\n70:51 此处提及为 Andrej Karpathy 讲解大语言模型原理的 YouTube 视频：Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT\n\n79:22 萨尔瓦多·达利（Salvador Dalí）：艺术家，超现实主义画家，下为他最知名的画作之一：\n\n\n\n《记忆的永恒》，The Persistence of Memory，1931\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n🧰 家庭财务工具箱\n\n信息已成洪流的 AI 时代，关注自己，想清楚未来的目标，并如实记录当下，可能会让我们对生活更有掌控感。\n\n我们 有知有行 App 的有行模块，已经逐步升级成为了你的家庭财务工具箱。这套工具箱可以帮助你更直观地记录和看见自己有多少钱，你的家庭资产是如何分布的，分配得是否合理，以及你是否有把家庭资产暴露在了不必要的风险之中。\n\n如果你是新用户，我们尤其推荐你从家庭资产记账开始，也许你会发现自己比想象中的更有钱。\n\n升级 有知有行 App 到最新版本，就可以体验到了，去试试看，希望你会喜欢。\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 韦青｜主持 雨白｜后期  明睿｜制作 雨烨 星星 ｜单集封面 Recraft\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "title": "The new Framework 13 HX370",
    "url": "https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-new-framework-13-hx370-68675e0e",
    "description": "The new AMD HX370 option in the Framework 13 is a good step forward in performance for developers. It runs our HEY test suite in 2m7s, compared to 2m43s for the 7840U (and 2m49s for a M4 Pro!). It's also about 20% faster in most single-core tasks than the 7840U.\n\nBut is that enough to warrant the jump in price? AMD's latest, best chips have suddenly gotten pretty expensive. The F13 w/ HX370 now costs $1,992 with 32GB RAM / 1TB. Almost the same an M4 Pro MBP14 w/ 24GB / 1TB ($2,199). I'd pick the Framework any day for its better keyboard, 3:2 matte screen, repairability, and superb Linux compatibility, but it won't be because the top option is \"cheaper\" any more. \n\nOf course you could also just go with the budget 6-core Ryzen AI 5 340 in same spec for $1,362. I'm sure that's a great machine too. But maybe the sweet spot is actually the Ryzen AI 7 350. It \"only\" has 8 cores (vs 12 on the 370), but four of those are performance cores -- the same as the 370. And it's $300 cheaper. So ~$1,600 gets you out the door. I haven't actually tried the 350, though, so that's just speculation. I've been running the 370 for the last few months.\n\nWhichever chip you choose, the rest of the Framework 13 package is as good as it ever was. This remains my favorite laptop of at least the last decade. I've been running one for over a year now, and combined with Omakub + Neovim, it's the first machine in forever where I've actually enjoyed programming on a 13\" screen. The 3:2 aspect ratio combined with Linux's superb multiple desktops that switch with 0ms lag and no animations means I barely miss the trusted 6K Apple XDR screen when working away from the desk.\n\nThe HX370 gives me about 6 hours of battery life in mixed use. About the same as the old 7840U. Though if all I'm doing is writing, I can squeeze that to 8-10 hours. That's good enough for me, but not as good as a Qualcomm machine or an Apple M-chip machine. For some people, those extra hours really make the difference.\n\nWhat does make a difference, of course, is Linux. I've written repeatedly about how much of a joy it's been to rediscover Linux on the desktop, and it's a joy that keeps on giving. For web work, it's so good. And for any work that requires even a minimum of Docker, it's so fast (as the HEY suite run time attests).\n\nApple still has a strong hardware game, but their software story is falling apart. I haven't heard many people sing the praises of new iOS or macOS releases in a long while. It seems like without an asshole in charge, both have move towards more bloat, more ads, more gimmicks, more control. Linux is an incredible antidote to this nonsense these days.\n\nIt's also just fun! Seeing AMD catch up in outright performance if not efficiency has been a delight. Watching Framework perfect their 13\" laptop while remaining 100% backwards compatible in terms of upgrades with the first versions is heartwarming. And getting to test the new Framework Desktop in advance of its Q3 release has only affirmed my commitment to both.\n\nBut on the new HX370, it's in my opinion the best Linux laptop you can buy today, which by extension makes it the best web developer laptop too. The top spec might have gotten a bit pricey, but there are options all along the budget spectrum, which retains all the key ingredients any way. Hard to go wrong.\n\nForza Framework!",

    "description": "本期是东腔西调和硅谷101的串台节目，我们邀请到了老朋友上海外国语大学教授施展老师，和硅谷101研究员刘一鸣老师，共同来聊一下目前全球聚焦的议题——川普的关税“战争”。\n\n早在今年1月，川普就任后就宣布对北美自由贸易区的两个伙伴加拿大和墨西哥加征25%的关税，引发此后两个多月两国反弹。在此预热之后，美国时间4月3日，川普宣布对对所有国家进口商品实施10%的基础关税，并对六十多个经济体补充了额外的关税。同日，中国宣布对美国进口商品加征34%关税，并对稀土等部分资源进行进口管制。4月7日，特朗普又宣布对中国加征50%额外关税，使总关税达到104%。4月9日，4月9日，国务院关税税则委员会发布公告，对原产于美国的所有进口商品加征50%关税，税率由34%提高至84%。\n\n与此同时，金融市场给出了迅速反应：4月2日宣布关税，到4月8日收盘，道琼斯工业平均指数下跌10.85%，标准普尔500指数下跌12.14%。聚集了美国科技龙头的纳斯达克综合指数损失最为惨重，这段时间跌幅高达13.26%。美国时间4月9日，川普在社交媒体突然发布消息，宣布暂停对近60个国家征收90天的所谓“对等关税”，而中国关税立即增至125%。\n\n从特朗普第一个任期以来，“美国第一”、扭转外贸逆差、促进制造业回流就是他一直强调的经济政策。最近一周“翻烙饼”式的关税政策更是展现了川普“极限施压”的理念。那么如此眼花缭乱的行为背后，有没有一条可以理解的潜藏线索？欢迎收听本期解读。\n\n特别感谢「硅谷101」对本期节目的制作支持。\n\n【本期对谈】\n\n何必，北京大学历史学博士\n\n施展，上海外国语大学全球文明史研究所教授\n\n刘一鸣，硅谷101研究员\n\n【收听指南】\n\n02:39 本轮川普关税战争政策时间线梳理\n\n05:05 拼勇气与最后通牒，十七十八世纪式外交策略回归\n\n07:47 中国供应链：不是转移而是溢出\n\n11:12 2018年起政治经济空间不重合，关税战不再能解决美国困境\n\n19:42 OPPO上百家供应链仅转移8家，德国车企隐形冠军供应商生死挣扎\n\n25:32 美国核心三大问题：美元高估、制造业空心化与美债危机\n\n29:57 米兰“海湖庄园协议”设想前提逻辑不对：制造业、通胀与国债的逻辑关系\n\n33:16 美国东西海岸联动从0到1与中部撕裂，中国完成从1到n的转化\n\n42:26 苹果的供应链与税务套利，但供应链很难回美国\n\n44:21 制造业回流美国难，AI与UBI才是解药\n\n48:08 新中世纪化：政治与商业空间的分裂\n\n52:07 两边承压的越南：关税战下将不再有价格优势\n\n58:16 越南泰国墨西哥地价翻倍，供应链深度转移难\n\n59:33 紧急发货与停下来观察，动荡期企业行动难\n\n01:04:35 利空彻底出尽，接下来该谈判了\n\n【提到的相关信息及更正】\n\na）桥水基金创始人达利欧对关税的文章《Don’t make the mistake of thinking that what’s now happening is mostly about tariffs》：\n\nx.com\n\nb）橡树资本创始人霍华德·马克斯的投资备忘录：《Nobody Knows (Yet Again)》\n\nwww.oaktreecapital.com\n\nc）斯蒂芬·米兰（Stephen Miran）发表的论文《重构全球贸易体系用户指南》（A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System）\n\nwww.hudsonbaycapital.com\n\nd）更正一些口误：\n\n13:08 2018年中国贸易顺差按美元计价为 3517.6 亿美元。\n\n13:22 德国顺差准确数据为2990亿美元\n\n【关于我们】\n\n一样的世界，不一样的思考。「东腔西调」是一档由大观天下志制作播出的轻文化播客，每周五更新，不定期加更，感谢你的收听。你可以在喜马拉雅、小宇宙、网易云音乐、QQ音乐、苹果播客、36氪、三联中读等各平台关注我们。欢迎多多留言评论，我们真诚感谢所有反馈，同时也期待更多脑洞。\n\n公众号：东腔西调\n\n听友群：添加小助手eidos000（备注「播客」）\n\n商务合作：contact@eidos.wiki",

    "description": "🤹 欢迎来到知行小酒馆，这是一档有知有行出品的播客节目，我们关注投资，更关注怎样更好地生活。我是雨白。\n\n毫无疑问，这几天大家最关心的事情就是关税。也有听众跑来问我，都这个节骨眼了小酒馆怎么还不讲一讲。\n\n的确，我们总以为，历史是新闻里滚动的大事，是属于国家、时代和未来的。但很多时候，它改变的，是你某一天的一个决定，一个家庭的生活节奏。那天你还以为只是平平无奇的一天，回头看，才发现它早已悄悄改写了你的人生轨迹。\n\n也正因为如此，身处新世界与旧世界的交汇点，我们更需要保持清醒与好奇，哪怕只是一点点坚定，去研究市场的机会与风险，并思考：在这个新世界里，我们该如何找到自己的安身之处。于是，我们有幸请来了一位非常受欢迎的嘉宾，公众号培风客的主理人陈老师返场，上次他跟我们聊完后「历史的高光时刻和垃圾时间」之后，就去了华盛顿，算得上是离这次风波最近的嘉宾了。\n\n本期节目录制于北京时间 4 月 8 日上午。在正式开始之前的一个温馨提示是，由于本期信息密度可能比较大，一期顶三期，建议大家先收藏，原速或者 0.75 倍速收听。觉得收听完全没有难度的朋友，可以在评论区为听不太明白的朋友答疑解惑一下。\n\n这期节目我很喜欢，希望对你也会有所启发。\n\n🔗 官方地址\n\n如果你所使用的客户端显示不全，请点此访问有知有行的官网查看全文\n\n🍻 本期嘉宾\n\n培风客：公众号「培风客」主理人，播客「铜镜」主播，知乎：Odysseus\n\n🚁 时间轴\n\n02:55  这个世界上有的数字没那么重要，但关税的增减，不在其列\n\n08:07  美国为什么要加关税？特朗普为什么要加关税？\n\n11:12  是的，股票跌了，但有接近 50% 的美国人几乎没有股票（也不关心股市）\n\n19:40  不止是盟友国，美国人也懵了：关税政策给我带来的到底是通胀，还是更好的就业机会？\n\n26:33 在特朗普团队充满误判的剧本中，美国是世界上最大的买家，而客户就是上帝\n\n31:40 全球化经济体系的确不够公平，但毁掉它并不是解决之道\n\n39:18 中国不是第一个站在这个位置的国家，美国和英国也曾经站过，而它们采取的方法都是一致的\n\n44:07 锥心之问：此时的我们能否自比为 100 年前的美国？产业结构可以，但文化底层上有非常大的区别\n\n52:15 判断投资中的任何问题：是短期问题还是长期问题？是周期性问题还是结构性问题？讨论关税问题，也一样\n\n63:33 关税政策出台之后，你可以做的两件事——\n\n64:47 美国过去100年的壮大，对中国有什么借鉴经验？它们当年做对了什么，才突破了英国对美国的封锁？\n\n71:48 当旧世界逐渐远去，我们需要做更多以前不会做的事情，才可能改变自己的命运\n\n🔍 猜你想看\n\n相关节目（附逐字稿）：特朗普关税政策扫射全球，对中国投资者的影响是什么?|我问陈博士 05\n\n最惠国待遇（Most Favoured Nation，MFN）：指缔约国一方现在和将来给予任何第三国在贸易、关税、航运、公民法律地位等优惠和豁免，也都给予缔约国对方国家。 享有最惠国待遇的国家称为受惠国，依据多是一项双边或多边条约的规定。\n\n帝国特惠制（Imperial Preference）：是一个互惠关税制度，旨在减免大英帝国与其自治领和殖民地，及自治领和殖民地之间的互相进口关税。这项制度在20世纪前期非常有效，最终在1977年作废。\n\n斯科特·肯尼斯·霍默·贝森特（Scott Kenneth Homer Bessent）：现任美国财政部部长\n\n彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）：是一名美国经济学家，现任美国总统顾问，曾任白宫贸易与制造业政策办公室主任、白宫国家贸易委员会主任以及《国防生产法》政策协调员。\n\n罗伯特·埃米特·莱特希泽（Robert Emmet Lighthizer）：美国律师，2017年被特朗普提名担任第18任贸易代表。曾在罗纳德·里根政府出任副贸易代表，曾经迫使日本接受钢铁及汽车出口的限制，一直到广场协议后的日圆大升值，最后是日本平成景气崩溃。\n\n🌐 知行小酒馆的公告牌\n\n📖 投资中，我们相信的事\n\n想告诉大家一个好消息，深受大家欢迎的节目嘉宾，友台《无人知晓》主播孟岩过去多年的投资实证，最近在微信读书结集上架了。\n\n这是孟岩从 2017 年开始的投资相关的真实记录，陪伴了很多有知有行的早期用户，最近几天的市场也不太平，我们在书里还看到了这周一，也就是 4 月 7 日关税战揭幕大跌那天书友写下的新笔记，一个人的直播变成了一群人的现场直播，很有趣。\n\n这本小册子叫做《投资中，我相信的事》，现在去微信读书，搜索「孟岩」或者「投资中，我相信的事」就可以看到啦。\n\n\n\n📮 我们有个信箱！给我们写信吧！如果你在投资生活中遇到了困惑，欢迎给「知行小酒馆」写信。不管是你苦恼于不知道怎样才能存下钱，还是纠结于怎样才帮身边人弄明白某个投资小问题，只要是关于钱的问题，都可以来信倾诉。虽然精力所限，不一定每一封信我们都会回复，但我们保证每一封信都会认真地阅读和保管。 来信请寄： allinthebeer@gmail.com\n\n🍻 我们是谁？「知行小酒馆」是有知有行出品的一档分享投资与生活的播客节目，每周五晚八点更新。我们关注投资理财，更关注怎样更好地生活。在我们看来，投资成功，是我们变成一个更好的人之后，自然的结果。\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。欢迎在「有知有行」社区 和我们互动交流。\n\n🛰️ 不管是在有知有行，还是小宇宙、喜马拉雅、QQ 音乐、网易云音乐、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、蜻蜓 FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music、Google Podcasts，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro、Snipd 等泛用型播客客户，我保证你都能找到我们的三档节目，《无人知晓》《知行小酒馆》和《投资ABC》。\n\n🎺 创作团队\n\n嘉宾 培风客｜主持 雨白｜后期 王方方 ｜制作 雨烨 星星 ｜单集封面 Recraft\n\n免责声明\n\n本播客所述投资相关内容皆以交流分享为目的，仅供参考，不构成任何市场预测、判断，或投资、咨询建议。市场有风险，投资需谨慎。主持人及嘉宾对投资相关内容的准确性、可靠性、时效性及完整性不作任何明示或暗示的保证，并提醒您对相关内容请结合自身情况进行独立评估，依据或使用相关内容所造成的后果由您独自承担。\n\n感谢您对本播客原创内容的青睐。如转载或引用本播客所述内容，请注明出处。转载前请与有知有行联系并取得同意。",

    "description": "在特朗普的最新关税政策下，以欧美为目的地的贸易和出海企业，正经历着新一轮的煎熬。\n\n自2019年以来，墨西哥已经成为中国企业出海的最热门的目的地之一。\n\n作为《美墨加协定》（USMCA）的成员国，从这里出口商品至美国可以享受零关税或低关税待遇。通过“墨西哥制造”的标签，中企既能绕开中美直接的贸易摩擦，又能提升供应链的韧性与效率。于是，大量中资企业扎堆在墨西哥投资建厂。\n\n本期播客的嘉宾苏秀勇，就是一名在身处墨西哥的中国出海人，他的任务，是帮助中资企业在墨西哥落地建厂。最近刚刚上线的商业纪录片《激流2》——第一集节目《闯关墨西哥》，就记录了他的出海生活。\n\n相隔14个小时，在墨西哥的深夜，我与苏秀勇在线上录制了这一期播客。听完这一期节目，相信我们不止能够理解出海墨西哥的大趋势，也能从个体视角中，感受到生动的异国文化碰撞、孤独的异乡人和大时代的机遇与代价。\n\n本期嘉宾：苏秀勇（际连建设墨西哥有限公司总经理）\n\n本期Shownotes：\n\n03:13 湖北小镇青年，从云南、深圳到远赴墨西哥\n\n06:04 2019年的墨西哥，面向美国为目标市场的近岸投资\n\n06:41 六年前，30万比索能买五公顷的土地\n\n07:51 疫情催生了中国企业加速出海墨西哥\n\n08:52 特斯拉要求中资供应商到墨西哥本地建厂，否则可能丢单\n\n10:16 在墨中资企业，原材料 98% 来自中国进口\n\n12:00 墨西哥的治安在提升，工人状况也在提升\n\n12:36 蒙特雷有一间酒吧：整面墙都是子弹打出来的\n\n13:38 前任总经理染上赌博和吸毒恶习：挪用公款后「消失」了\n\n15:38 工厂大本营蒙特雷：紧邻美国德州，这里的中资企业已经达到 600 家\n\n16:28 以蒙特雷为圆心画个圈：你能组装起一台汽车\n\n17:59 地价飞涨，蒙特雷饱和，华雷斯的中国企业也在变多\n\n19:05 墨籍同事从特雷塔罗到圣路易斯的路上，「被人在腿上打了两枪」\n\n19:43 随身携带较多的现金，就是为了应对抢劫\n\n20:42 墨西哥思维、中墨之间的沟通瓶颈，一度让我心态破防\n\n22:57 自从特朗普参选，中资来墨西哥的脚本就放缓了\n\n23:44 4月2号的最新关税政策，墨西哥并不在加税之列：「一些客户着急选址建厂房」\n\n24:08 要造房屋还不容易：墨西哥地质坚硬，往下挖有火山页岩层\n\n26:11 墨西哥人尤其注重自尊：中企要在这里学会尊重\n\n30:05 一旦感到不被尊重，墨西哥员工可能掉头就走，「第二天就不来上班了」\n\n31:33 我的墨西哥同事，会在喝酒碰杯时将杯子放低\n\n33:08 墨西哥用工成本并不低：一个普工的成本可能在7000人民币上下\n\n35:34 他们不存钱，周三周四便开始借钱过日子了\n\n37:29 「全球没有任何一个国家像中国人这样求上进」\n\n37:57 墨西哥财团，从法律到工商，各个行业都会涉足\n\n39:15 关于民族荣辱的思考：同样苦难的历史，造就了不同的文化\n\n39:48 「连他们的太阳神庙，也建了耶稣」\n\n41:08 人们告诫我不要去墨西哥农村，他们说「太危险」，可我还是去了\n\n42:21 被拉去派对喝酒：语言不通，但是快乐会感染你\n\n43:00 「中国同事来到自己家里，他们会很自豪」\n\n43:41 就像《寻梦环游记》里，墨西哥的亡灵文化，令我想到了自己的家乡\n\n44:54 办公室旁150米就是一个火葬场，在最繁华的街区\n\n46:08 周末人们会扛着音箱，在街上跳舞快闪\n\n46:29 「有时也挺羡慕他们」\n\n46:48 我只是个客人，派对散场，只令我更思念自己的家人\n\n37:24 出海人的无奈：踏上这条路可能难以回头\n\n50:04 女儿看了《激流2》给我发信息：爸爸你在外面真的很辛苦\n\n52:40 现在是墨城最美的时节：盛开的蓝花楹，很陶醉，很梦幻\n\n54:27 中国人来到这里：从不理解，到羡慕\n\n57:59 「他们有很多个明天」：如果是我，早就被老板干掉八百回了\n\n58:46 中企闯关墨西哥，一个「闯」字背后有多少挑战\n\n01:04:52 中高层应该来本地呆上三个月，但很少有人真的这么做\n\n01:07:58 「发展新能源是墨西哥的不二之选」\n\n01:13:28 4月2号特朗普公布最新关税后，许多企业加快了选址建厂的步伐\n\n01:15:10 想家，但是「我对墨西哥市场充满了信心」\n\n加听友群👇：\n\n有关主理人：卫诗婕，独立商业作者，曾任《极客公园》执行总编，早年任职于《人物》、GQ报道、字节跳动。代表作：《ofo的终场战事》、《罗永浩：薛定谔的理想主义》、《朱一旦的枯燥生活》、《中东社交十年风云：金矿、折戟、浪潮再起》、《下一站，沙特》等。作品曾获虎嗅2024年度作者、金字节奖年度新锐作者、网易非虚构文学奖年度作者、全球真实故事奖中文报道十佳。\n\n有关「商业漫谈」：这是一档关注科技、商业、人文的深度访谈节目，致力于记录时代的商业史。聚焦商业趋势、伦理、竞争、价值。\n\n「打捞时代碎片，文字对抗时间。」\n\n微博：卫诗婕SJ_Jelyne\n\n小红书：诗婕Jane's talk",

    "description": "从体重2g的鼩鼱到深海巨物鲸鱼，所有哺乳动物的心跳都是恒定的，平均一生心跳15亿次；从动物到植物到公司到城市，规模效应实现的效率都是相似的。这些惊人的事实都体现了系统运作的神奇之处。那么什么是系统？\n\n自然有其系统，所以春夏秋冬四季变换，动物、植物、微生物都能在自然中和谐共处；城市有其系统，所以各行各业都能在其中正常运转；公司有其系统，所以在激烈竞争中得以存活。系统的运行有什么特点？神奇的系统是如何自下而上慢慢形成的？我们如何规避系统的陷阱，以及利用系统思维做出有利于自身的决策。我们将从《规模》和《系统之美》这两本书中找到答案。\n\n在合上书的那一刹那，看着这两本让我掉了无数头发和睡着无数次的书，我竟然发现，我get了一些看待这个世界和自我的“上帝视角”。 不得不说，系统思考者是我现在能理解的，最顶级和王者的思维。所以今天我和guxi, 真的是迫不及待，也想“折磨”一下你们。但相信我，这种折磨是值得的！\n\n🌟Highlights（*为引用）\n\n  \n系统思考者，其实就是将世界视为各种反馈过程的组合。*\n  \n每当能量被利用或转化以制造或维持一个封闭系统的秩序时，某种程度的混乱便是不可避免的——熵趋于增大。*\n  \n维持一个进化中系统的秩序与结构需要源源不断地供应和使用能源，而其副产品则是无序。这就是为了存活我们必须持续进食以应对熵产生的不可避免的破坏力的原因。熵能杀人。最终，我们都将屈服于各种形式的磨损和衰竭。*\n  \n我们在许多系统中看到的“复杂”的背后或许真的蕴藏着“简单”。*\n  \n只要规模足够大，混乱中必然涌现秩序。\n  \n先看世界，世界观自会涌现。\n  \n信息就是权力。\n\n\n00:01:03 姥姥已进入待产期，接下来一两个月，自习室进入薛定谔的更新时间。\n\n00:06:44 蚂蚁的各方面能力都碾压人类，但它自身的结构和系统注定了它只能长那么大。\n\n00:17:01 真正的宿命论：从体重2g的鼩鼱到深海巨物鲸鱼，所有哺乳动物的心跳都是恒定的，平均一生心跳15亿次。\n\n00:20:26 规模效应：从动物到植物到公司到城市，规模效应的效率都是相似的。\n\n00:25:05 规模递增达到临界点，就会迎来一次系统崩溃，从而进入规模递减的运行系统。\n\n00:40:04 为什么有些时候越努力越后退？\n\n00:47:05 用长度不同的标尺测量海岸线，得出的结果可能相去甚远。\n\n00:50:52 达成共识的前提是我们看待事物的颗粒度相同。\n\n00:52:45 破坏大自然的调节系统，急功近利往往事与愿违。\n\n00:57:52 系统的层次性：利用系统思维进行工作流程设计，学会“组块儿”。\n\n01:01:28 系统的自组织：每一只蚂蚁在无领导的情况下无意识劳动，形成了蚁群的强大效率。\n\n01:05:43 为什么语言学习中词汇的重要性远远大于语法结构？当语素充足，秩序必然涌现。\n\n01:09:28 有限理性：当一个环保主义者成为被诟病项目的管理者，他能更好的推进项目吗？当一个员工变成管理者，他能更好的体恤当初的同事吗？\n\n01:14:16 克服政策阻力：催生的正面典型。\n\n01:21:04 公地悲剧的解法：让每一位鼓吹宣战的政客自己上前线。\n\n01:23:40 富者愈富：所有公司的隐藏目标都是侵吞一切，和癌细胞一样。\n\n01:25:08 利用系统思维1：相信、尊重并分享信息，就会形成权力。\n\n01:26:12 利用系统思维2：语言构成世界，把对我们有利的语言多多放入我们的字典里。\n\n01:29:30 利用系统思维3：为反馈系统创造带有反馈功能的政策——及时奖励。\n\n01:31:59 利用系统思维4：跨领域学习，像张无忌一样，忘掉一切，进入无为之境。\n\n01:36:26 本期学习推荐。\n\n节目中提到的壁画《雅典学派》（又译“雅典学院”）\n\n感谢瑷尔博士对本期节目的大力支持！\n\n瑷尔博士是姥姥和Guxi经常随身携带的护肤选择。这次给大家推荐三款明星洁面产品，做好清洁工作，为护肤打底。\n\n  \n洁面慕斯 - 适合和Guxi一样的干敏皮朋友，氨基酸表活，“零帧”起泡，味道温和，不拔干不黏腻。\n  \n洁颜蜜3.0 - 适合油脂分泌旺盛的朋友，包裹式囊泡清洁，只洗掉坏油脂，留下滋润皮肤的好油脂。\n  \n蓝胖子卸妆霜 - 清洁力强的情况下温和不刺激，边卸妆边养肤。\n\n\n花卷专属购买方式\n\n点击链接领券下单：s.tb.cn\n\n记得下单备注【自习室】！额外申请了花卷专属福利，像洁颜蜜购买正装额外赠送中样*1+mini便携耳机包；卸妆膏（正装100g+替换装100g）下单备注实际到手105元，含赠品卸妆膏8g*1；券的使用时间只到3/28号且以上赠品不和店铺页面赠品叠加喔～\n\n📕本期学习推荐\n\n  \n纪录片《蚂蚁王国》\n  \n伯恩斯情绪疗法 - David D.

    "description": "最近我受邀看了一部电影，叫《不说话的爱》，看完我和同行的伙伴们都泪如雨下，崩溃大哭，它启发了我对父爱有了很多新的观察，也让我更加关注到听障人士这个群体。所以今天我邀请到了这部电影的男主角，也是第一次饰演爸爸的张艺兴，一起聊一聊在聋人世界中获得的成长与收获，以及我们在多元身份下的尝试与平衡。\n\n03:41 手语并不复杂，不同地区的手语也有方言；\n\n04:40 张艺兴：人最大的需求还是社交，语言不通造成误解是最可惜的；\n\n07:40 我们如何定义「父爱」？分享生活中拥有爱的实体感受；\n\n11:03 父亲是一个特别需要被需要的角色，他们的爱可能是“自我”且沉默的；\n\n12:00 「沉默的父亲」——东方男性的角色教育；\n\n17:07 听到，但是不能听到——饰演听障人士时需要克服的生理反应；\n\n20:20 人心中的成见就像一座大山，它们来源于信息差之间的误解；\n\n23:15 「LAY了就可以躺一下」，慢下来也是一种平衡；\n\n27:05 对自己松绑——允许自己有缺点，接受事情未完成；\n\n32:38 与听人世界不同，感受聋人世界里的简单、直接、善良；\n\n35:20 理解「拒绝」公式：明确拒绝、充分理由、解决方案建议；\n\n36:50 自如的自我，自由的人生，都由各种未知的碰撞组成；\n\n39:26 成长过程的裂变——感受、认知、破碎、重组；\n\n44:07在多重身份中寻找优先级，明确自己的第一身份；\n\nBGM: 《Human In You》\n\n/关于《不说话的爱》/\n\n《不说话的爱》由青年导演沙漠执导，陈国富监制，张艺兴领衔主演聋人父亲“小马”，李珞桉饰演其女儿“木木”。故事改编自沙漠2021年执导的同名获奖短片，定档2025年4月3日全国上映。\n\n/关于《杨天真的高情商公式》/\n\n高情商=满足自己＋成全别人=成事\n\n我的高情商课程 总结了我过去工作和生活中高情商成事儿的实践经验，28节音频课，从底层认识到行动，教大家成为不仅让自己爽，还能成事儿的人。",

    "description": "本期嘉宾是找钢集团的创始人王东。\n\n20 岁，他在川大创立 Home 战队，手下管着近千人的公会。彼时的他是个好奇心旺盛的学生，常被老师批评「无组织、无纪律」。2000 年，电竞市场尚未成型，连上网都要靠拨号「猫」。《星际争霸》刚崭露头角，吸引了一批高校热血少年在战网集结。他们玩着全英文游戏，忍受 6.4k 速率的卡顿，在没有 Replay 的日子里蹲守比赛直播。曾拿下全国第二的王东回忆：「是《星际》，让我第一次看见了互联网。」\n\n2011 年，上海钢贸危机爆发，市场留下巨大空白。传统行业迎来转型关口，一众 B2B 企业应运而生。战队老队员鼓动他来上海，让那个每天在电视机前看《赢在中国》的钢铁职业经理人动了心。他给真格的 Dream Center 发了一封邮件，很快就收到了真格的回信、拿到了天使轮投资。找钢网也是真格投资的第一家 B2B 公司。一年后，他召集了 11 位创始成员，找钢网由此诞生。\n\n如今，找钢集团的数字化平台连接约 1.5 万名注册卖家和超 18 万名注册买家，是中国最大的三方钢铁交易数字化平台。2023 年，找钢集团的数字化平台录得三方钢铁交易吨量 4730 万吨，约占中国三方线上钢铁交易总吨量的 40%。\n\n北京时间 3 月 10 日，找钢集团成功挂牌港交所，股票代码：6676.HK。此次上市，标志着找钢集团将成为港股近三年来首个登陆主板的钢铁电商企业，也是中国境内第一家通过 De-SPAC 路径在港上市的公司。\n\n十三年创业，他如何在行业变革中穿越周期？本期节目，我们与王东聊聊找钢集团的成长与蜕变，一起看看这家钢铁 B2B 企业是如何炼成的。\n\n【本期嘉宾】\n\n王东：找钢集团创始人兼 CEO\n\n【时间轴】\n\n从物理老师到钢铁电商创始人\n01:17 从高校老师到互联网公司\n02:25 钢铁从供不应求到产能过剩\n05:32「找」到互联网创业的时代机会\n07:10 教师和做 B2B，本质都是人力资源管理\n10:47 从郑州到上海，因电竞机缘决定创业\n12:44 一封寄给真格 Dream Center 的信\n13:42 从中国最大的钢铁自营贸易商转型平台\n\n创业者的必备素质\n18:31 创业者最需要的是对环境的认知能力\n20:27 管理一个游戏公会比上个大学更「有用」\n22:43 DeepSeek 之后，年轻人要变得更高频\n23:03 只要这个星球还在使用钢铁，就需要找钢\n24:25 AI 最核心的是解决 B2B 的售前环节\n25:47 我比较崇拜马斯克的第一性原理\n29:11 年轻人第一份工作闲点不是啥坏事\n30:34 所谓舒适区是短暂的舒适\n\n对找钢未来最大的想象\n32:50 找钢到底能做多大？\n34:42 认知是钢铁行业的第一要素\n36:51 人是有天堑的，隔行如隔山\n44:21 销售是让别人相信你想让他相信的话\n47:28 新兴领域的创业者是没有退路的\n49:03 博弈是一次次的破釜沉舟\n50:26 天与弗取，反受其咎\n\n如果你也相信科技改变世界，热爱实践与创造，欢迎联系真格梦想中心 Dream Center：dream@zhenfund.com\n\n【Staff】\n\n监制：Cindy、Jiamin、Wendi\n后期：Keyone Studio\n\n【关于真格】\n\n《此话当真》是一档由真格基金出品的泛商业类播客，真格基金投资团队将在此和各领域的领军人物一起分享最新热点和行业洞察。\n\n真格基金创立于 2011 年，是国内最早的天使投资机构之一。自创立伊始，真格基金一直积极在人工智能、芯片与半导体、机器人与硬件、医疗健康、企业服务、新能源、跨境出海、消费生活等领域寻找最优秀的创业团队和引领时代的投资机会。\n\n真格，你的创业第一站!\n\n【联系我们】\n\n公众号: 真格基金（ID: zhenfund）\n官网链接：www.zhenfund.com\n邮箱：media@zhenfund.com\n\n你可以通过小宇宙、苹果Podcast、喜马拉雅收听我们。\n如对节目有任何的建议与期待，也欢迎大家在留言中互动~",

    "description": "如果有人问你，给你三个月的时间，你能把目前手上负责的业务数据翻十倍吗？\n\n相信大多数人都会觉得这是痴人说梦，但这件事 ACE Studio 做到了。\n\n而他们做到的原因不是他们本来就能，而是有人让他们相信了这件事。\n\n这就是我们今天要讲的故事，这就是信念感这三个字的力量。\n\n去年 5 月份我们做过一期 PMF 主题的节目，ACE Studio 的创始人 Joe 聊了很多他们的产品是如何在美国市场找到 PMF 的。当时他们刚刚开启付费半年，就已经做到了很不错的月收入。这次我们又把他请来，是因为才刚过去了大半年，他们的收入竟然就增长了 10 倍，已经成功跻身千万美金 ARR 第一梯队。\n\n能做到这点，是因为他们去了硅谷一家很有名的孵化器 HF0，并在那边搞了 3 个月的封闭式开发。这期播客中，Joe 就毫无保留地分享了 HF0 到底是怎么奏效的、他们在 HF0 的实际体验与收获，和实现 10 倍增长的具体经验（比如他们是怎么一招就让公司一夜之间收入翻倍的？）。\n\n如果你对 Joe 的参加孵化器的经验，或者对去美国参加类似的组织感兴趣，可以添加我的微信 qukai42，42章经今年也会组织更多中美连接的活动和事情，欢迎你用各种方式加入进来。\n\n【人类博物馆】\n\n导游：曲凯，42章经创始人\n\n20 号珍藏：Joe，ACE Studio 创始人。ACE Studio 是一款面向专业音乐制作人和创作者的 AI 音乐工作站，致力于用 AI 重新定义音乐创作，自 2023 年 10 月上线以来发展迅猛，月收入已达 80 万美金。\n\n【时光机】\n\nPart1 HF0 为什么有效\n\n  \n01:23 先回顾下入选这家美国知名孵化器的过程    \n      \n03:48 英语不好会是阻力吗？\n      \n05:34 3000 进 10 的概率下，HF0 为什么选中了你们？\n    \n  \n  \n07:19 HF0 和其它孵化器不太一样\n  \n08:46 HF0 没教我们怎么做业务，这事也不该别人来教\n  \n10:35 最关键的第一步：HF0 给我们注入了「一定能猛涨」的信念感    \n      \n12:23 这种信念感很难自我激发\n    \n  \n  \n14:23 开营后，HF0 营造了一个专注于增长的氛围    \n      \n16:25 最大的压力和最深的恐惧就是「别丢脸」…\n      \n17:44 这种氛围本质上改变了我想问题的方式\n      \n19:17 也让我们涌起了「别让大家觉得华人不行」的责任感\n      \n21:38 一直 build「憋大招」可能并不成立\n    \n  \n  \n22:40 从 HF0 出来后，还能保持在其中的状态吗？    \n      \n23:55 我们马上要复刻 HF0 的体验\n    \n  \n\n\nPart2 3 个月涨 10 倍的具体实践\n\n  \n26:50 五周过去都没怎么增长的时候，信念感崩塌了吗？\n  \n27:43 绝境逢生的戏剧化转折：我们试了一招，第二天日收入直接 double    \n      \n28:51 Quora 创始人教会了我们一种思考方法\n      \n30:00 之前没想到这么干，是因为我们没悟到一件事\n      \n31:18 要问这招是啥？——答案乍一听可能有点搞笑哈\n      \n31:29 但搞笑背后是一种硅谷的方法论\n      \n32:57 在硅谷的几个经历也启发了我们\n    \n  \n  \n33:53 后面我们还试了很多招数，最终达成了 10 倍的增长    \n      \n34:01 我们在价格模型上做了很多文章\n      \n34:24 Blake Anderson（千万美金 ARR 产品 Cal AI 的创始人）让我意识到，我们之前联系 influencer 的方式都不对\n      \n36:33 我们把付费广告的 ROI 提高到了 2 倍\n      \n36:59 产品功能升级和老用户也没落下\n    \n  \n  \n37:30 但前六周的苦工是省不掉的\n\n\nPart3 一些观察\n\n  \n39:02 美国投资人的工作方式和提的问题有什么不同？\n  \n40:31 美国机构真的很不喜欢中国团队吗？\n  \n42:51 肉身到硅谷去很重要\n  \n43:12 我越来越坚信，AI 产品化大有可为    \n      \n44:44 Perplexity 的 pitch deck 上有两句话，合起来看很妙\n      \n45:13 我的壁垒就是我的「人日」\n    \n  \n  \n46:47 硅谷的做事风格越来越回归本质了\n\n\n【Reference】\n\n  \nACE Studio 产品界面\n\n\n\n\n  \n关于 HF0：HF0 是由 Dave Fontenot（世界上最大的黑客松 MHacks 创始人）、Evan Stites- Clayton 和 Emily Liu 共同创立的常驻创业孵化器，有着严苛的筛选标准，由包括 Marc Andreessen、Chris Dixon 在内的多位知名投资者支持，创办第一年就孵化出了 3 家独角兽公司，也孵化过包括 ComfyUI、Story.com 等在内的多家优秀的 AI 公司。\n\n\n【The gang that made this happen】\n\n  \n制作人：陈皮、Celia\n  \n剪辑：陈皮\n  \nBgm：Mondo Bongo - Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros",

    "description": "♾️ 大家好，欢迎来到「无人知晓」，我是孟岩。\n\n本期节目的嘉宾，是一位与我渊源已久的朋友，陈行甲老师。我经常会写一些文字，放在公众号上、微博上。从很早的时候，就经常有人在下面留言：孟岩，你的文字和你在做的事情，很像一个人，那个人叫陈行甲。\n\n这一次，我终于有机会，请到了陈行甲老师做客「无人知晓」。这期节目的录制过去了很久，我已经完全不记得我们都聊了什么。但有一些记忆碎片残存在脑海中 ——\n\n是聊天过程中数次红润的眼眶；\n\n是反复出现的用来形容自己状态的词——「喜悦」；\n\n以及那句我印象非常深的话：\n\n「他们落水了，水很凉」\n\n我也希望能通过这期播客，把这些瞬间分享给你，愿有所启发 ～\n\n🔗 官网地址\n\nyouzhiyouxing.cn\n\n💬 本期嘉宾\n\n陈行甲：公益人、作家。历任镇长、（县级市）市长、县委书记等职，辞任后于 2017 年创立恒晖公益基金会，现任深圳市人大常委会社会建设委员会委员。已出版：《在峡江的转弯处》《别离歌》等。\n\n🕗 时间戳\n\nPart 1  喜悦\n\n02:33「我的父亲，热烈又恬静，深刻又朴素，温柔又高傲，微妙又率直」\n\n07:05  教育是一门艺术，而不是一门技术\n\n10:07  一个「会思考，有关怀，爱自由」的人，不会被年龄困住\n\n14:20  喜悦，是心生欢喜\n\n19:40  公益工作中，如何拥有共情他人又不损耗心力的自愈力？身受，进而感同；帮助他人，进而安顿自己\n\n28:15  人最终会去到自己该去的地方，有人侥幸逃脱了，但侥幸逃脱的人，到死都不会心生喜悦\n\n23:40  建立一条属于自己的、清晰的底线，遵循它而行动：在这个冷酷而混乱的世界里，终究存在着一种宏大的公平\n\n31:18  是否一个纯粹清醒又理想主义的人，最终只能辞官？离开官场八年后，陈行甲这样回答——\n\n39:00「这个世界，好之者不如乐之者，乐之者不如信之者」\n\n42:28  我压根没想到怕，我只是觉得：老子不服。\n\nPart 2  别离歌\n\n46:20  「商业是最大的慈善」，离开政界后，为什么陈行甲选择了公益而非商业？\n\n48:33  见过大海的人就不迷恋于江河\n\n52:12  有些离去是无法治愈的，既然放不下，就一直带着吧\n\n55:30  为什么会有那么多家庭因病致贫？这绝不仅仅是医疗费的问题，「通过帮这些孩子，我是来探路、找方法和试错的」\n\n60:26  不要指望生活的落水者能有多优雅，「他们落水了，水很凉。」\n\n63:16  理想的实现有两种方式：我实现了理想，或是理想通过我得到实现\n\n70:24  人人都有对物质的追求，但你越不追求，你就越不缺乏\n\n74:54  喜悦来自于，我们追求事情本身，而不是把事情当成目的\n\n82:04「凡是找到的，都不再是你要找的」\n\n87:24  没有分别心的慈悲，就是去理解每个人生命的处境\n\n95:51  一个没有爹味的爹：世界是什么样子，你自己去看，自己去闻，自己去触摸，自己去走，我不会告诉你正确答案\n\n99:34「恒晖」是一缕恒久的、淡淡的光亮，是永远相信美好的事情即将发生\n\n🎵\n\nAmaksi - Midnight Flash\n\nEmpty - Greg McKay\n\n🫳 创作者们\n\n嘉宾 陈行甲\n\n主播 孟岩 @有知有行\n\n后期 柯霖 @顺带一提\n\n制作 有知有行\n\n  \n关于无人知晓\n\n\n无人知晓是一档由孟岩主理的投资向对话类播客。每期都会邀请一位好友来做客。至于更新频率、嘉宾选择、每期主题，就如同这个名字一样，无人知晓。\n\n孟岩还打造了一款帮助普通人投资的产品「有知有行」，希望能够帮助到你。\n\n  \n关于有知有行\n\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。\n\n欢迎在各大应用商店搜索「有知有行」下载我们的 App\n\n  \n收听方式\n\n\n有知有行、小宇宙、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、喜马拉雅、QQ音乐、网易云音乐、蜻蜓FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro 等泛用型播客客户端。",

    "url": "https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/67403d1d11045e78e5105c6f",
    "description": "👋 Hi，\n\n迟更了一年的播客，下面是当时写的草稿。\n\n回头看看生命中的压舱石，多了一块，也少了一块。多的是，刘小野来到了地球；少的是，见人嚎回到了喵星。\n\n这个话题源自于去年读的一本小说，蔡崇达的《命运》。书中让我留下印象最深的，是阿太生命中的那些压舱石；\n\n所谓压舱石，其实就是和某些人或某些事，建立深厚且长期的关系。这些关系拉着自己在困难的时候不至于翻了船，也让自己始终有前进的方向。\n\n其实不知道你有没有类似的感觉，初到一个城市，生命像浮萍一样。是什么让我们能感到安心呢？是你知道这个城市里面有你关心的人，有关心你的人。有你相见的人，有离不开你的人。你知道自己该做什么事，也知道什么事自己不喜欢。你知道每一个角落的秘密，你能给异乡人指路。此处安心是吾乡。\n\n这一切，都是关系。我们和这个陌生的世界建立了关系，而这些关系，就成为了我们生命的压舱石。\n\n只不过，许多人没有意识到这是财富，而是变成了负担。因为在 35 岁左右，感觉周围和自己有关系的，无论是人还是事，开始稳固，老化，颓败。一切都趋于稳定，但也让自己陷入很深的恐惧，因为这些不变的关系就像是秤砣一样压着自己喘不过来气，仿佛像一列加速驶向死亡的列车，而车窗都被焊死。\n\n为何会变的负担呢？其实是对于这些拥有的东西足够熟悉，继而忽略，缺少持续的投入。\n\n看着曾经的压舱石不满青苔、腐烂。人们往往会做出许多离谱的事情，比如试图和过去的一切割席，让自己焕然一新，但被囚禁在瓮中无法脱身，郁郁寡欢；又或者是盲目投身于建立新关系……\n\n其实这么做，短期内会让人感觉很好，就像突然清仓了股票获得了一笔现金，然后去看各种可能性，听到各种美好的故事，自然让会让人觉得精神矍铄；但却忽略了，当你投入之后，一切就又会进入上一个轮回。\n\n并且最可怕的是，关系只能通过时间来投资，没有其他的捷径；而时间又是我们最稀缺的资源，既不能存储，也不能赊账。\n\n生命行至半途，手中的弹药已然不多，再试图和过去割席重建，虽说不是没有胜率，但是大概率会让结果惨淡。\n\n再回头看看，那些生命中已然存在许久的关系，真的那么不堪么？还是有许多细微的变化，自己没有注意到呢？所以大多数时候，我们需要的是修复，并保持，也就足够了。\n\n比如慢慢耕耘 flomo；比如从写下第一行字；好事不会突然发生，坏事却总是一夜之间到来。只不过许多的认知和这个事实相反。\n\n这些具体而深厚的关系拉着自己，扎根在粗糙的大地之上，做着具体的事情。而在不断行动的过程中，我们逐渐填满了生命的意义 —— 用一辈子的时间，和什么事情建立了深厚的关系。\n\n其实正是这些深厚的关系，拉着自己没有变的轻浮，比如无论何时，都知道有个家能回，有几只猫子在等；又比如每天睁开眼就知道自己的责任所在，能让被服务的人体验更好一些。\n\n如果余生只有这么多时间，那么，你愿意把它们用在哪里？和什么样的人或事情建立关系，让他们成为你生命中的压舱石？你又想驶向何方，做些什么事情，让其他漂泊的人啊，能因此不再惧怕风浪。\n\n🎵 音乐：\n\n  \nMoonlight Drawing by MONO\n  \nRainy Dance by Haruka Nakamura\n\n\n 🎭 关于我：\n\n  \n和老搭档一起做一款笔记工具「flomo」 和一个付费专栏工具「小报童」。\n  \n在写一份邮件通讯「产品沉思录」，也写过一本书《笔记的方法》。\n  \n常居杭州，喜爱在山林中行走。\n  \n……",

    "description": "Introduction\nHi everyone! I’m Huong (Celine) Hoang, and I’m thrilled to share my experience working at Qdrant this summer as part of their Summer of Code 2024 program. During my internship, I worked on integrating cross-encoders into the FastEmbed library for re-ranking tasks. This enhancement widened the capabilities of the Qdrant ecosystem, enabling developers to build more context-aware search applications, such as question-answering systems, using Qdrant’s suite of libraries.\nThis project was both technically challenging and rewarding, pushing me to grow my skills in handling large-scale ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) model integrations, tokenization, and more. Let me take you through the journey, the lessons learned, and where things are headed next.",

Compressing vectors reduces memory usage while maintaining nearly all of the essential information. This method allows for more efficient storage and faster search operations, particularly in large datasets.\nWhen working with high-dimensional vectors, such as embeddings from providers like OpenAI, a single 1536-dimensional vector requires 6 KB of memory.\nWith 1 million vectors needing around 6 GB of memory, as your dataset grows to multiple millions of vectors, the memory and processing demands increase significantly.",

Why does it have the potential to become a platform?\n\n27:47 Will there be a convergence of vectorDB? How do we think about competition from incumbent databases such as PGVector by Postgres?\n\n32:57 Takeaways from the announcements from Databricks and Snowflake summits in June 2024\n\n36:15 When do we need a new data format? Why is opensource important for data format?\n\n43:14 How will AI change the data infra landscape? What will stay, what will be replaced, and what will emerge?\n\n52:31 Why does Chang think that RAG is similar to recommendation systems?\n\n55:34 How to evaluate if a new opportunity is for incumbents or startups?\n\n57:57 What are some common mistakes in building data infra?

    "description": "♾️ 大家好，欢迎来到「无人知晓」，我是孟岩。\n\n今天这期节目，已经在我的脑海中盘旋了将近一年的时间。我想和你分享，这一年里我对一连串话题的思考，比如，知识的缝隙、细微的差别（Finer Distinction）、独一无二的能力（Unique Abilities）、生命的意义（Ikigai）。\n\n这些词语的含义大相径庭，但因为各种有趣的线头，我得以将它们串在了一起，这条线让我对投资和生活，又添了一层新的理解。\n\n所以，我想记下这些思考的脉络，它从哪儿来，又带我去了哪里，说不定也能对你有所助益。\n\n接下来，就让我从第一个线头说起吧。\n\n🪡 穿针引线\n\n  \n芒格的大猩猩与知识的缝隙\n\n\n02:09 费曼学习法与「知识的缝隙」\n\n07:45 知识的边界在哪里？虽然从亚里士多德时期开始就有人开始认识鳗鱼，但我们依然对鳗鱼知之甚少\n\n13:23 如果有得选的话，尽可能「把手弄脏」\n\n19:40 理解「知识的缝隙」有什么用？\n\n  \n识别「缝隙」的能力\n\n\n25:58「智慧，是区分细微差别（Finer Distinction）的能力」\n\n28:48 当一个个知识的缝隙被填满，世界的拼图也就变得更为完整了，这会很大程度上让我们更有余裕面对变化的周遭\n\n33:39 那些人无我有的能力 = 在某个领域，你填了比别人都多的缝儿\n\n40:30 但是，怎样才能找到这样的领域呢？也许，我们应该避免平均地分配自己的时间和精力\n\n49:58 所谓「能力圈」，就是那个你不假思索地就能认定自己拥有的能力\n\n  \n祝愿你能成为那个找到 Ikigai 的幸运儿\n\n\n60:12 对于想在某个领域做出伟大成就的人来说，能力、兴趣、努力和运气都是必须的\n\n65:47 Ikigai 是什么？\n\n73:14 今天的缝隙就填到这里，接下来看你的了，祝你好运\n\n🚩 猜你在找\n\n本期播客的第一个线头：费曼学习法\n\n费曼学习法是由美国物理学家、诺贝尔物理学奖得主理查德·费曼提出的。其核心就是，通过小朋友都听得懂的语言，向别人解释一件事，来检验自己是否真的弄懂了这件事。 如果讲着讲着卡壳了，说明那个知识点你也没弄明白。重新学习，再讲一遍，直到自己也完全搞明白。\n\n\n\n本期最后的那根线头：Ikigai 是什么？\n\nIkigai，翻译过来大概是生活的价值或者目标一类的含义。简单来说，它分了四个维度，分别为：\n\nWhat you LOVE：你的热爱\n\nWhat you are GOOD AT：你的擅长\n\nWhat the world NEEDS：世界需要什么\n\nWhat you can be PAID FOR：你的工作（为什么有人付你钱）\n\n然后这几个圆圈的各种交集就挺有意思的：\n\n热爱和擅长的交集，是「激情」\n\n热爱和世界需要的交集，是「使命」\n\n擅长和工作的交集，是「专业」\n\n工作和世界需要的交集，是「天职」（大概就是工作之上赋予了更多意义感）\n\n更进一步，\n\n热爱、擅长、世界又有需要，这意味着喜悦和充实，只是很难赚到钱\n\n热爱、擅长、又有人付钱，这意味着满足的状态，只是缺乏了一些意义感\n\n擅长、有人付钱，又在做别人需要的事情，这意味着舒适、安逸，但会感到有些空虚\n\n热爱、有人付钱、世界也需要，这意味着兴奋、满足，只是总会有面对不确定性的不安全感\n\n最后，如果把这四样都集齐了，那就是 Ikigai 的状态。这个状态是什么，我想已经很难用文字来形容了，只有达到那个状态的幸运儿，才能体验。\n\n\n\n播客里提到的一些信息：\n\n公众号：孟岩\n\n视频：投资是怎样赚钱的\n\n文章：《四笔钱是怎么来的？》《How to Do Great Work（中文版）》\n\n书：《鳗鱼的旅行》《10x Is Easier Than 2x》《纳瓦尔宝典》\n\nBGM：\n\nAmaksi - Midnight Flash\n\nFrequently Asked Music - Land Of Forgotten Dreams\n\nEliho - In Morning Mist\n\n🫳 创作者们\n\n主播 孟岩 @有知有行\n\n后期 柯霖 @顺带一提\n\n制作 有知有行\n\n  \n关于无人知晓\n\n\n无人知晓是一档由孟岩主理的投资向对话类播客。每期都会邀请一位好友来做客。至于更新频率、嘉宾选择、每期主题，就如同这个名字一样，无人知晓。\n\n孟岩还打造了一款帮助普通人投资的产品「有知有行」，希望能够帮助到你。\n\n  \n关于有知有行\n\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。\n\n欢迎在各大应用商店搜索「有知有行」下载我们的 App\n\n  \n关于投资第一课\n\n\n《投资第 1 课》是有知有行出品的投资入门课程。你可以随时随地在「有知有行」App 里免费阅读完整内容，但如果你希望买一本实体书来读读，可以在微信中搜索小程序「有知有行的店铺」，购买由读库出版的《投资第 1 课》精装本。\n\n此外，你还可以在各大视频平台看到它的视频版：《投资是怎样赚钱的？》\n\n  \n收听方式\n\n\n有知有行、小宇宙、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、喜马拉雅、QQ音乐、网易云音乐、蜻蜓FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro 等泛用型播客客户端。",

    "description": "♾️ 大家好，欢迎来到「无人知晓」，我是孟岩。\n\n每年我都会有一本自己的年度之书，2022 年是《千脑智能》，2023 年是《为什么伟大不能被计划》；今年年初我开始看《超越百岁：长寿的科学与艺术》，读到一半时我开始思考，或许我今年的年度之书已经找到了。\n\n本书作者彼得·阿提亚在书的开头讲述了一个他的梦：\n\n我站在一个看起来很像巴尔的摩的大城市人行道上，手里拿着一个填充的篮子，抬头看着。每隔几秒钟，我就看到一个鸡蛋从上面飞下来，我跑到篮子里试图抓住它。它们飞快地朝我飞来，我尽力去抓它们，像外场手手套一样张开我的篮子到处跑。但我抓不住它们。很多——撞在地上，黄色的蛋黄溅得到处都是，弄脏了我的鞋子和医疗服。我迫切希望这一切能停止。这些鸡蛋是从哪里来的？一定有一个人在楼顶或阳台上，随意地把它们扔过栏杆。但我看不到他，我太忙了，几乎没有时间去想他。我只是到处跑，试图抓住尽可能多的鸡蛋。但我失败了。\n\n彼得说，他几乎忘记了所有的梦，但二十年后，他似乎无法将这个梦从脑海中抹去。彼得曾经是一名癌症外科医生，他曾经得意于自己所经历的手术的复杂性，但有一天他意识到，几乎所有患者都会在几年内死去。鸡蛋不可避免会落地。\n\n他说：「我终于意识到，解决这个问题的唯一办法不是变得更擅长接鸡蛋，而是想办法阻止扔鸡蛋的人。」这就是这本书的来源。\n\n读到这里的时候，我一下子想到了我自己的经历。我经常被朋友问到，自己那些跌了 50% 的基金应该怎么办？这些问题我很难回答。这些基金是不是能回本，什么时候能回本，就像那些飞出来的鸡蛋，落地的命运早在买入的时候就已经注定了。\n\n健康和投资一样，也许我们可以做的，是爬到楼顶，找到那个扔鸡蛋的人。\n\n本期节目我邀请了我的好朋友、本书序言的作者顾中一，我们将结合这本书聊一聊健康、长寿、超越百岁的秘诀，以及如何赶在鸡蛋落地前，找到那个扔鸡蛋的人。祝你收听愉快。\n\n🔗 官网地址\n\nyouzhiyouxing.cn\n\n💬 本期嘉宾\n\n顾中一：北京营养师协会理事，清华大学公共卫生硕士。 所著科普书畅销十余万册。自媒体（全网同名）：营养师顾中一\n\n🕗 时间戳\n\n01:46  看完这本 2024 年的年度之书， 孟岩请来了它的序言作者\n\n04:00  老生常谈、全是噱头？常年做健康科普的嘉宾顾中一表示，原来它是真有料\n\n12:49  记录、观察、总结、反馈：比起忙不失迭地应付生活扔来的「鸡蛋」，更根本的解决之道或许是去思考「鸡蛋」从哪儿来的\n\n15:36  生命不只有「人生尺度」，还有「健康尺度」，人至晚年的理想状态是两者兼顾\n\n如果我想让自己长寿又健康，我该注意什么？\n\n18:34  像存「养老金」一样存身体的「健康基金」：你不会从 60 岁开始存养老金，那也不要从 60 岁才开始关注身体健康\n\n22:33  参考中医的「上医治未病」思想，我们怎么能更好地「提前管理」自己的健康？\n\n26:21  医学 2.0 - 医学 3.0：除了生病知道看医生，我们每个人都应该掌握与身心健康相关的基本常识\n\n31:56  人到晚年，如何活出高质量？关注四大方面：运动、营养、睡眠、情绪管理\n\n  \n运动篇 🏋️\n\n\n34:17  以为自己在运动上做得不错的孟岩，发现让人长寿的锻炼要满足四个关键点 ——力量、最大有氧适能、有氧效率、稳定性\n\n37:20  打鸡血准备开启健身的朋友请注意 ⚠️ 太久不动突然恢复锻炼，可能会「横纹肌溶解」\n\n  \n营养篇 🍚\n\n\n44:31  轻断食、生酮、地中海式饮食...花里胡哨的饮食法有很多，盲目跟风尝试，不如关注营养的基础要素\n\n49:39  妈妈的叮嘱听了这么多年，原来不吃早饭 ≠ 会得胆结石？！\n\n50:27  想要吃得营养健康，又没那么多精力每顿饭精心研究最佳膳食配比，可操作的思路有什么？\n\n54:25  代餐奶昔、果汁和补充剂：需要吃吗？吃多少合适？能代替正常饮食提供营养吗？\n\n  \n睡眠篇 🛏️\n\n\n64:34「超越百岁的睡眠管理」：确保睡眠时长，提高睡眠质量\n\n67:55  睡眠门诊：如果生活方式干预无效，求医也许能帮你发现影响睡眠的真正元凶\n\n  \n情绪管理篇 🍀\n\n\n71:39  每月写 200 多条生活记录的顾中一：当一些事引起了我们的情绪波澜，书写与记录能帮助你更好地理解它\n\n79:15  不论是情绪管理还是公司管理：尽力改变我们能改变的，平静接纳我们不能改变的\n\n站在人生的末端回望，我希望自己度过了富足、健康、有意义的一生\n\n82:06  「悼词美德 」vs. 「简历美德」：你要为了一个更完美的简历生活，还是......？ 🪦\n\n84:47  孟岩想了想，他理想中的有知有行 10.0.0 版本长这样——\n\n☁️ 猜你想搜\n\n22:33 「上医治未病，中医治欲病，下医治已病」\n\n这句话出自两千多年前的《黄帝内经》，指医术最高明的医生，是在病人发病之前给予建议；次一等的医生就在病人欲发病之时给予医治；最下等的医生就是在病人发病之后才给予治疗。\n\n84:17 《品格之路》\n\n在这本书中，作者戴维·布鲁克斯对「简历美德」与「悼词美德」作出了区分。\n\nBgm\n\nAmaksi - Midnight Flash\n\nFrequently Asked Music - Land Of Forgotten Dreams\n\nRoad Less Traveled - Stories in Sound Studios\n\n🫳 创作者们\n\n嘉宾 顾中一\n\n主播 孟岩 @有知有行\n\n后期 柯霖 @顺带一提\n\n制作 有知有行\n\n  \n关于无人知晓\n\n\n无人知晓是一档由孟岩主理的投资向对话类播客。每期都会邀请一位好友来做客。至于更新频率、嘉宾选择、每期主题，就如同这个名字一样，无人知晓。\n\n孟岩还打造了一款帮助普通人投资的产品「有知有行」，希望能够帮助到你。\n\n  \n关于有知有行\n\n\n有知有行成立于 2020 年，目前在陪伴投资者用正确的方式学习投资，下场实操。凭借在投资领域的良好口碑，有知有行在初创阶段已与一大批忠实用户同行。未来我们希望成为一家财富管理公司，不仅帮助投资者学习投资，也能让大家在有知有行安心交易，踏实赚钱。\n\n欢迎在各大应用商店搜索「有知有行」下载我们的 App\n\n  \n关于投资第一课\n\n\n《投资第 1 课》是有知有行出品的投资入门课程。你可以随时随地在「有知有行」App 里免费阅读完整内容，但如果你希望买一本实体书来读读，可以在微信中搜索小程序「有知有行的店铺」，购买由读库出版的《投资第 1 课》精装本。\n\n此外，你还可以在各大视频平台看到它的视频版：《投资是怎样赚钱的？》\n\n  \n收听方式\n\n\n有知有行、小宇宙、苹果播客、豆瓣、三联中读、喜马拉雅、QQ音乐、网易云音乐、蜻蜓FM、荔枝播客、微信听书、Spotify、Amazon Music，以及 Overcast、Pocket Casts、Castro 等泛用型播客客户端。",

    "description": "♾️ 大家好，欢迎来到「无人知晓」，我是孟岩。好久不见。\n\n在第四季的开篇，我想和你分享的是我最近一直在脑海中酝酿的话题之一——我们应该如何面对截然相反的人生建议？相信你和我一样，也曾想过同样的问题。\n\n不管是这两年销售火爆的《纳瓦尔宝典》，还是我们成长路上听人说的道理，通常都是短小精悍的金句。乍一听很有道理，但一比对就会发现，所谓的人生智慧或者建议，有很多都是自相矛盾的。\n\n我举一个例子，比如说，巴菲特在 2018 年度的致股东信里面给了我们一个建议：忘记树木，专注于森林。提醒我们应该把注意力和时间放在那些对结果有重大影响的事儿上，不要在乎那些细枝末节。但与此同时，我们也经常听到「细节是魔鬼」「细节决定成败」。\n\n那当我们真正的面临选择的时候，究竟该用谁的智慧来指导自己的人生呢？\n\n在没有更新的这段时间，我见了很多人，比如，我很尊敬的作家凯文·凯利（Kevin Kelly）；我脑海中的很多构想也顺利落地，比如，我在上一期提到的视频、有知有行的《海外投资白皮书》（如果你想存下来慢慢看，可以点击这里下载 PDF 版本）。这些经历也让我对上面这个问题的答案，有了更多的思考。\n\n我想，现在是时候分享给你了。\n\n🔗 官网地址\n\nyouzhiyouxing.cn\n\n🔦 时间戳\n\n01:22 没更新播客的时候，孟岩在忙些什么？一个全平台播放过 1000 万的视频、一份 20000 字的《海外投资白皮书》\n\n03:15 进入正片：我们应该如何面对截然相反的人生建议？相信你和我一样，也曾想过同样的问题\n\n08:33 琴师苏纳和佛佗的故事：松紧恰到好处，才能奏出美妙的音乐\n\n13:30 如果想获得良好的生活，简单地从两个极端之间中取平衡值，就够了吗？\n\n19:52 为什么孟岩一边要求「小步快跑、不断迭代」，一边要求「不留遗憾地做两年视频」？\n\n27:14 失败是成功之母 V.S. 成功是成功之母，这对矛盾背后值得注意的真相是：一旦某个不可能之事被打破，其它人也会更有信心去尝试\n\n29:54 为什么孟岩很认同「我们要同时追求两件互相矛盾的事」这样的说法？\n\n33:30「我们的感受是真实的，但不意味着基于这些感受的看法和解释就是客观真实的」\n\n35:59「了解自己最好的方法就是去理解和自己不一样的人和事」\n\n41:39 他人的道理不应是指导行为的工具书，而是说，要从更宽广、更高层次的维度理解万事万物\n\n🌲 好奇心\n\n📚 书：《纳瓦尔宝典》《宝贵的人生建议》《马斯克传》《富兰克林传》《长期主义》《金钱心理学》《解码者》\n\n📃 文章：如需查看股东信，可以点击巴菲特致股东信 1957~2021 年全集，也可以在微信读书等平台搜索；如需查看霍华德·马克斯的备忘录，请前往微信公众号「橡树资本 Oaktree Capital」搜索\n\n🎧 播客： Kevin Kelly x BYM x 无人知晓：你拥有令天使羡慕的生活\n\n📇 人名：\n\n张之臻、郑钦文（🎾 网球运动员）\n\n查理·芒格（Charlie Munger，💰 投资人）\n\nF. 斯科特·菲茨杰拉德（F.

    "description": "大概有半年多没有更新了，一方面忙于诸多事项，不得抽身；另一方面则是没有太多想要表达的东西，太多事情需要默默做好。\n\n时至秋日，许多去年的种子开始结果，也终于能探头喘口气。\n\n感谢「晚点聊 LateTalk」的汉洋的邀请，这次在杭州和刘飞一起，三个人聊了聊关于产品经理十年。其实这个岗位挺奇怪的，从压根没有，到东拼西凑，到光环四射，再到人人喊打。\n\n但其实，许多争执，要么是定义问题，要么是阶段问题。放一放交给时间，回头再看时一切就豁然开朗。唯一不变的是，热爱可抵岁月漫长。\n\n（十年前和 light 想要开发，但是却没有开发完的产品设计，一款读书笔记的工具。在这之后，我们分别就踏上了各自的创业旅途，直到十年后重新相聚，做起了 flomo ）\n\n下面是晚点聊节目的 Shownotes，经授权搬运过来，并感谢剪辑师的剪辑。\n\n---\n\n15 年汉洋回国创业的时候，产品经理这个岗位风头正劲。《人人都是产品经理》基本上是创业者必读。他在北京的时候还经常接待一些二三线城市过来学习产品经理课的朋友。\n\n后来产品经理这个角色随着创业大潮的消失也跟着声量低了。再后来更多人认为产品经理也不过是大公司的螺丝钉之一。也有不少人说产品经理需要有大的机会，但现在的互联网只能提供一些小修小补的机会了。\n\n不过这两年独立开发的兴起让很多人似乎看到了产品经理的另一种可能——虽然独立开发一直都有，但大厂失速后众人才会花时间看这些以前认为比较「小」的事儿。失速后众人才会花时间看这些以前认为比较「小」的事儿。也有人感觉大模型让产品经理的春天又回来了。\n\n最开始我们可能把产品经理看得太重要了、然后又把它看的太不重要了。也许现在是一个重新回看、再次聊聊这个职业的好时机。\n\n本期嘉宾少楠和刘飞都是在产品经理刚诞生那时候入行的人，这十年也在不断见证着这个职业的变化兴衰。\n\n本期节目我们聊到了：\n\n  \n少楠和刘飞的职业经历\n  \n如何看待产品经理这个职业？这个行业这几年有什么显著的变化？\n  \n如何做一个好的产品经理？\n  \n今天的年轻人还应该从事这个职业吗？\n  \n人们对产品经理有哪些常见的误解？\n  \n产品经理的课有用吗？如果没用，如何成为一个好的产品经理？\n  \n这个行业起起伏伏这些年，有什么自己感觉有意思的故事？\n  \nAfter all，产品经理给你带来了什么？\n  \n有什么你曾经坚信的事情现在不信了？有没有什么曾经不信的事儿现在相信了？\n  \n为什么都出来自己做事情了？\n  \n彼此下一步的计划是什么？\n\n\n相关链接：\n\n  \nflomo\n  \n三五环\n  \n半拿铁\n  \n产品沉思录\n  \n三五杯冷泡茶\n  \n小报童\n\n\n登场人物：\n\n  \n刘飞：制作冷泡茶中，也制作有冷泡效果的播客\n  \n汉洋：沉迷冷泡茶中\n\n\n剪辑：甜食",

    "description": "一次播客的「公路片」，一次回顾 2022 的旅程，一些精神食粮的分享，一次夹带私货的音乐分享，部分文字稿内容点此。\n\n如果说这一年最大的收获，便是在合伙人 @Light 的影响下，重新理解了「实事求是」\n\n  \n更加追求「真」，而非「美」，尤其是叙述意义上的「美」；\n  \n可以客观地讨论「事实」，而不让自己情绪参与其中；\n  \n以工程的视角来做事，而非像艺术家一样依赖灵感。\n\n\n想来也有些可笑，许多与我不熟之人，都认为我极端理性，如理工科出身一般。但自己却知道，内心依然敏感冲动，依旧可以因为一句歌词落泪，一篇诗句而感慨 —— 一如本文开头的那首曲子。\n\n用感性，去感受世界的多彩固然重要；但如果想改造世界（或者说，抵抗被世界改造），则需要用理性处理一个又一个问题，就像《火星救援》中那样，当你解决完一个又一个问题之后，就可以回家了。\n\n另一方面，当第一年创业时，需要的是发散思维来捕捉机会，用感性去扭曲现实力场；但当业务进入轨道时，就需要切换到工程模式来，一边解决问题，一边设计解决问题的机器。从设计产品到写书，从组织团队到财务，概莫如此。\n\n所以回望这一年，和自己情绪的斗争逐渐减少，更多的是开始步履蹒跚的重新理解一个又一个事实，做出一个又一个判断，然后重复这个过程。\n\n这里是 2022 年总结，也是 36 岁的一个句号。它们琐碎，跳跃，却又在冥冥之中像一条河流，将自己引向更宽广的大海。\n\n🎵 音乐\n\n  \n致我的迷茫兄弟 by 声音碎片\n  \n巨轮 by 左小祖咒\n  \nStrands by Ludvig Forssell\n  \nThis is A life by Son Lux\n  \n春暖花开去见你 by 福禄寿\n  \nMarginalia #113 by Masakatsu Takagi\n\n\n私人推荐\n\n  \n产品沉思录精选\n  \n边听播客边用 flomo 做笔记，欢迎通过奇想驿邀请码注册。",
